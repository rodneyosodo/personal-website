Hello and welcome to my blog series about the robotics dojo competition. I'll be documenting my progress in the [JKUAT Robotics Dojo](https://roboticsdojo.github.io/). The robotics dojo is an intensive program that aims to train student engineers on the relevant skills and knowledge to develop robots. This program will encompass training on the knowledge together with building the robot for a final competition at the end of the training.

Cheers
