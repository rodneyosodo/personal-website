Hi there! My name is Osodo Rodney David and I am a mechatronics engineer with a passion for combining the fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science to design and create innovative systems and devices. I am also a software developer and electronics tinkerer. I am in love with using technology to solve our problems, triggered by my intuition to make our future better. With a strong background in both theory and practical application, I have a unique skill set that allows me to approach problem-solving from multiple angles and find creative solutions to complex challenges.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, including the development of rockets, the design and implementation of control systems, and software engineering.

1. Rockets: As a mechatronics engineer, I have experience working on the development of solid propellant rockets under the Nakuja Rocket. One example of the rocket I helped design and fabricate was the Nakuja N1 rocket. The N-1 rocket is our first rocket powered by a solid rocket motor that uses sugar and potassium nitrate as the propellant. The airframe is 3D printed and equipped with the minimum required flight electronics. The specifications were: Length: 99.6 cm, simulated total weight: 1.28 kg, simulated apogee: 285 m, airframe material: PLA (3D printed), propellant: KNSU (G146 class 40mm SRM), simulated total impulse: 110 Ns. The recorded apogee was 34 m. I have also helped design and fabricate the N2 rocket. More information about this can be found on the [Nakuja Project website][1]

2. Control Systems: I have also worked on the design and implementation of control systems for a variety of applications. One example is a control system that helps mobile platforms move in holonomic and omnidirectional motion. The system was able to monitor and adjust various process variables, such as the yaw and pitch of the mobile platform, in real-time to ensure optimal holonomic motion. This type of control system is crucial for navigational robots. More information about this can be found in the [Omicron Github organization.][2]

3. Software Systems: In addition to my work on rockets and control systems, I have also been involved in the integration of, [mainflux][3], a modern, scalable, secure, open-source, and patent-free IoT cloud platform written in Go. It accepts user and thing (sensor, actuator, application) connections over various network protocols (i.e. HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP), thus making a seamless bridge between them. It is used as the IoT middleware for building complex IoT solutions. I was instrumental in enabling the platform to switch to a multi-broker system, whereby we can have either Nats, RabbitMQ or Kafka as the internal message broker for sending and receiving messages between different adapters. This type of system is essential for the development of distributed IoT solutions.

During my life at [JKUAT][4], I have co-founded [Qualislabs][5], a startup that aims to build products for the African Market. We have been prototyping the [Ujuzi device][6] that helps you monitor and remotely control your device in the house. [Qualis vision][7] is a wearable device that helps the blind navigate their day-to-day tasks. [Mavuno][8] is an application to combat food waste and reduce the country's 5.2 million tonnes of food lost each year The app connects farmers, drivers, and buyers on a single platform, intending to reduce food waste after harvest by saving time on logistics and providing farmers with direct access to traders. I have also co-founded [TabiriHealth][9], a for-profit Healthcare Technology Company that leverages on technology to design and develop low-cost, highly sensitive wearables which will be used in the monitoring of respiratory functions of neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Units. Positive Impact.

One of the hallmark moments of my life at JKUAT is being able to join the [Nakuja project][1]. Nakuja is a team of students from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) and the Pan African University Institute for Basic Sciences Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI). We are focused on learning as we design, build and launch a rocket into the earth's orbit.

I have also been able to work with different clubs and societies i.e JKUAT Society of Computer Science and Information Technology (SCOSIT), JKUAT Google Developer Student Clubs [(GDSC)][10] and JKUAT Society of Engineering Students [(SES)][11]. I have taken roles in different clubs which have immensely benefited me to advance my career while networking with like-minded colleagues.

I have also been able to work with different clubs and societies outside school i.e Python Nairobi User Group [(PyNBO)][12] and we host the biggest tech events in sub-Saharan Africa dubbed [PyConKE22][13]. I have also been part of the Ai Saturdays Nairobi Chapter where we have been able to share information and learn together to help advance our Artificial intelligence capabilities.

I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find the information here helpful and please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or opportunities.
