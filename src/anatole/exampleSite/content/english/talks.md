### 1. [Artistic Circuitry: Exploring the World of PCB Art - at Africa Open Hardware Community 2023](AfricaOpenHardwareCommunity2023.pdf)

 In this virtual session, we will dive into the exciting world of PCB art and explore how it combines the realms of art and technology. From the traditional uses of PCBs in electronics to the more creative and unconventional ways of using them for art, we will examine how designers and artists are pushing the boundaries of circuit board design. The session will cover various techniques and tools used for making PCB art, including design software, etching, soldering, and wiring. We will also discuss the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this art form and how it can be used to express creativity and innovation. By the end of the session, participants will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the intersection of art and technology in the world of PCB art.

### 2. [Controlling Holonomic and Omnidirectional Robots Using Android - at DroidConKE 2022](droidconKE22.pdf)

The goal of this talk is to show how android applications can be used to frontier robotics in the 4th industrial revolution. The project will demonstrate how we have built a flutter mobile application to control an omnidirectional and holonomic robot. This control will be accomplished by varying motor speed and direction, resulting in varying directions of motion. The goal is to have a prototype mobile platform capable of carrying a load of 40 kg that can be controlled remotely using an Android application. This platform will not require manual control but instead be operated remotely via a mobile application software or hand motion control.

### 4. [Unriddling Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Architectures - at PYCONKE 2022](PYCONKE2022.pdf)

The problem we will attempt to solve is to use Quantum Machine Learning to classify the MNIST dataset using a Variational Quantum Classifier. To solve this problem, we will employ a hybrid of classical and quantum neural networks. We will use a dimension reduced dataset due to the length of time required to solve the entire problem.

### 5. [Gong Show - at QOSF 2020](GONGSHOWATQOSF.pdf)
