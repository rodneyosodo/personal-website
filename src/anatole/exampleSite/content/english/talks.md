### 1. [Controlling Holonomic and Omnidirectional Robots Using Android - at DroidConKE 2022](droidconKE22.pdf)

The goal of this talk is to show how android applications can be used to frontier robotics in the 4th industrial revolution. The project will demonstrate how we have built a flutter mobile application to control an omnidirectional and holonomic robot. This control will be accomplished by varying motor speed and direction, resulting in varying directions of motion. The goal is to have a prototype mobile platform capable of carrying a load of 40 kg that can be controlled remotely using an Android application. This platform will not require manual control but instead be operated remotely via a mobile application software or hand motion control.

### 3. [Unriddling Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Architectures - at PYCONKE 2022](PYCONKE2022.pdf)

The problem we will attempt to solve is to use Quantum Machine Learning to classify the MNIST dataset using a Variational Quantum Classifier. To solve this problem, we will employ a hybrid of classical and quantum neural networks. We will use a dimension reduced dataset due to the length of time required to solve the entire problem.
