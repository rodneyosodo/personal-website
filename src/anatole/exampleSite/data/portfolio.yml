        description: 'This is a prototype device for smart farming. The smart farm has DHT11 sensor which measures temperature and humidity, a light-dependent resistor that measures the light intensity and a soil moisture sensor that measures soil moisture content. We have an irrigation system and fan system symbolized by a solid-state relay. When the soil moisture is low the eris dev kit automatically starts the irrigation system to raise the soil moisture content. If the soil moisture rises until it reaches a certain level the irrigation system is closed. When the temperature is high the fan and irrigation system is turned on to reduce the temperature of the microclimate. If it drops to a certain level the two systems are stopped. When the humidity is low the irrigation system which is overhead the crops is started to raise the humidity to optimum levels. If it is high the irrigation system is stopped. For light intensity, we are tracking the records to be able to make better decisions in the future maybe by data analysis.'

        link: https://github.com/omicronrobot
        linktext: 'Visit Github Organisation'
        description: 'This project, therefore, proposes a prototype mobile platform with both holonomic and omnidirectional motion whilst using castor wheels. Since castor wheels are difficult to control we intend to introduce Direct Current (DC) Motors that will enable the control of the castor wheels. This allows the platform to move in complex trajectories without stopping to reset the wheels. Ground clearance has been enhanced on the created platform, which is important for outside difficult terrain activities.'

        description: 'The Satima motor driver is a powerful motor driver based on the DRV8870 that can be used to driver either 1 bidirectional or 2 unidirectional DC motors. It is based on MOSFETs making it power efficient. It has a built in voltage supply based on the AMS1117-5V low dropout regulator.The satima s1a motor driver is an ideal motor driver compared to the L9298N motor driver.'
