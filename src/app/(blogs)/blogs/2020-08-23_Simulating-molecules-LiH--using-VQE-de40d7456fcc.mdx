### INTRODUCTION

Fundamentally, light was believed to be a wave. However, Albert Einstein found
that light consisted of photons called quanta, which have energy determined by
its frequency. Photons of visible light can be absorbed by an electron, thereby
causing the electron to move from a low energy orbital to a high energy orbital.

Determining these properties is difficult for a classical computer since the
electrons may be highly entangled. To model this accurately, we require more
computational power, and this is where quantum computers come into play.
Compared to classical computers, they are more efficient at handling
entanglement.

LiH is a 12 body molecule containing 4 protons, 4 electrons, and 4 neutrons.
This creates a 12 body model, which becomes intractable when simulating it both
with a classical and quantum computer. So, this model reduces the First
Quantized Molecular Hamiltonian to one two body interaction between two
electrons in the hybridized p orbital and four one body interactions with their
respective nuclei.

One of the essential properties is the ground state energy of a molecule.
Finding the ground state energy of these molecules becomes harder as the size
of the molecule increases, which is why until now, the largest simulated
molecule is Beryllium Hydride. Molecular simulations' problems grow
exponentially as the size of molecules increase. Some of the applications of
these problems are in drug discoveries.

### PROCESS

The variational principle explains how the energy of any trial wave function is
greater than or equal to the system's exact ground state energy.

It is important to find the minimum eigenvalue of a matrix; in Chemistry, the
minimum eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix is the ground state energy.

**1. We map the molecular Hamiltonians into qubit Hamiltonians.** We find the
fermionic operators and map the fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit Hamiltonians.
For this transformation we use

1. Jordan Wigner transformation leads to N-local Hamiltonians
2. Bravyi-Kotoev transformation leads to log(N) local Hamiltonians
3. Partity transformation

We then copy the electron orbitals interactions to qubits.

#### 2. We create an ansatz.

The expectation value of any wave function will be at least the minimum
eigenvalue associated with the wave function.
The ground state of the Hamiltonian system is the smallest eigenvalue
associated with the Hermitian matrix.

**3. Parameter optimization**

One problem that arises is noise, meaning the energy calculations may not be
true. We try and overcome this by gradient descent, which also has its
problems. We use Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) as
the ideal optimizer. It works by perturbing all the parameters in random. Under
noise, Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) and Constrained
Optimization BY Linear Approximation (COBYLA) are preferred.

### IMPLEMENTATION

Notebook is
[here](https://gist.github.com/rodneyosodo/698ee32dde649ace70ad1152d276f748)

### Defining your molecule:

In this challenge, we will focus on LiH using the sto3g basis with the PySCF
driver, which can be described in Qiskit as follows: `inter_dist` is the
interatomic distance.

```python
inter_dist = 1.6
driver = PySCFDriver(atom='Li .0 .0 .0; H .0 .0' + str(inter_dist), unit=UnitsType.ANGSTROM, charge=0, spin=0, basis='sto3g')
```

We also set up the molecular orbitals to be considered and can reduce the
problem size when we map to the qubit Hamiltonian. Hence, the amount of time
required for the simulations is reasonable for a laptop computer.

```python
# please be aware that the idx here with respective to original idx
freeze_list = [0]
remove_list = [-3, -2] # negative number denotes the reverse order
```

### Now, you can start choosing the components that make up your VQE algorithm!

#### 1. Optimizers

The most commonly used optimizers are `COBYLA,` `L_BFGS_B,` `SLSQP,` and `SPSA.`

#### 2. Qubit mapping

There are several different mappings for your qubit Hamiltonian, `parity,`
`bravyi_kitaev,` `jordan_wigner,` which in some cases can allow you to reduce
the problem size further.

#### 3. Initial state

There are different initial states that you can choose to start your
simulation. Typically people choose from the zero state

```python
init_state = Zero(qubitOp.num_qubits)
```

and the UCCSD initial state

```python
HartreeFock(qubitOp.num_qubits, num_spin_orbitals, num_particles, map_type, qubit_reduction)
```

#### 4. Parameterized circuit

There are different choices you can make in the form of variational forms of
your parameterized circuit.

```python
UCCSD_var_form = UCCSD(num_qubits, depth=depth, num_orbitals=num_spin_orbitals, num_particles=num_particles)
RY_var_form = RY(num_qubits, depth=depth)
RYRZ_var_form = RYRZ(num_qubits, depth=depth)
swaprz_var_form = SwapRZ(num_qubits, depth=depth)
```

#### 5. Simulation backend

There are different simulation backends that you can use to perform your
simulation.

```python
backend = BasicAer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
```

### Compare the convergence of different choices for building your VQE algorithm

Among the above choices, which combination do you think would outperform others
and give you the lowest estimation of LiH ground state energy with the quickest
convergence? Compare the results of different combinations against each other
and the classically computed exact solution at a fixed interatomic distance,
for example, `inter_dist=1.6`.

To access the intermediate data during the optimization, you would need to
utilize the `callback` option in the VQE function:

```python
counts = []
values = []
params = []
deviation = []
def store_intermediate_result(eval_count, parameters, mean, std):
    counts.append(eval_count)
    values.append(mean)
    params.append(parameters)
    deviation.append(std)

algo = VQE(qubitOp, var_form, optimizer, callback=store_intermediate_result)
algo_result = algo.run(quantum_instance)
```

### Compute the ground state energy of LiH at various interatomic distances

By changing the parameter `inter_dist,` you can use your VQE algorithm to
calculate the ground state energy of LiH at various interatomic distances, and
potentially produce a plot as you see here. Note that the VQE results are very
close to the exact results, and so the exact energy curve is hidden by the VQE
curve.

### NOTE: I am not using the noisy model

```python
distances = np.arange(0.5, 4.0, 0.1)
exact_energies = []
vqe_energies = []

        qubit_reduction,
        shift,
    ) = compute_LiH_qubitOp(map_type="parity", inter_dist=dist)
    # Classically solve for the exact solution and use that as your reference value
    ref = exact_solver(qubitOp) + shift
    # Specify your initial state
    init_state = HartreeFock(
        num_spin_orbitals, num_particles, "parity", qubit_reduction
    )
    # Select a state preparation ansatz
    # Equivalently, choose a parameterization for our trial wave function.
    var_form = UCCSD(
        num_orbitals=num_spin_orbitals,
        num_particles=num_particles,
        initial_state=init_state,
        qubit_mapping="parity",
    )
    # Choose where to run/simulate our circuit
    quantum_instance = Aer.get_backend("statevector_simulator")
    # Choose the classical optimizer
    optimizer = SPSA()
    # Run your VQE instance
    vqe = VQE(qubitOp, var_form, optimizer, callback=store_intermediate_result)
    # Now compare the results of different compositions of your VQE algorithm!

    ret = vqe.run(quantum_instance)
    vqe_result = np.real(ret["eigenvalue"]) + shift
    print(
        "Interatomic Distance:",
        np.round(1.4, 2),
        "VQE Result:",
        vqe_result,
        "Exact Energy:",
        ref,
    )
    exact_energies.append(ref)
    vqe_energies.append(vqe_result)

Hopefully, you have gained a firm understanding of how VQE works and can now
implement one on your own. Leave some claps and follow me for more content. I
