The first decentralized cryptocurrency (**bitcoin**) was created in 2009 by a
developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Then in April 2011 namecoin was created a
decentralized D.N.S _(this is the Domain Name Service that maps the ip address
of your favorite web server to the name it translates to)_ this would make
censorship of the internet difficult to control.

## The Government

That was just a preview that i will come back to later. Initial the West had
created the fiat which a currency which has intrinsic value and usually created
by the government. The dollar, the kenyan shilling the south Africa rand is just
a government fiat. How this fiat works is that is that fiat doesn't use value
but again then the value is maintained by the respective governments and by the
parties engaging in trade. Okay then how does the government make money? In Kenya
De la rue makes money for use. The government controls the money they make and
the can influence the creation of new excess money that would lower its value
but again the they want to make it scarce so that it could have a high price not
compared to the Zimbabwe currency. This is just the front end of the money making
business. But they are people who control. The government banks and other famous
people know when to invest and when not to invest. In the west the famous and
rich people would know when to buy a house that would be cheap and after maybe
10 - 15 years it would be their fortune. The fact that people think that the bank
lends you money that some else has put in the bank but what the commercial bank
actually does is to create money and lend it to you at interest.
If i manufacture money in my own house its called counterfeit, when an
accountant creates money it's called “cooking the books” but if a bank does it
it's perfectly legal and so long as you allow fraud to be legal we will
continuously have problems. Now thats sound absurd many people don't believe it
and you have the right to disbelieve. When the don't have to change the system
to make too much money they convince people that its their fault like their wage
claims are too high or people are speculating houses that is why the housing fees
is high. The government is the one to created fiat but the banks create money by
lending to their customers. The supply of money has grown exponentially from the
time its its was introduced.

Who benefits of course the government and then those companies and individuals
that get money early they can spent it for the prices of things they wants to
buy before they gain like shares. What about those at the bottom of the pyramid,
those in the villages and remote areas. By the time this newly created money has
filtered in the system down to them, the prices of the things they want to buy
has risen. They have to save or even take a loan to but houses. Thus this cycle
of money just keeps distributing he money from the poor to the rich. Thus the
even increasing gap between the rich and the poor is ever increasing.
Are you poor or rich ?

## The Blockchain

Then came the block-chain technology which uses a hash function maybe SHA3 512
or scrypt as its proof of work. Those who know is that its had to cheat unless
you have 50% of the money in the whole cryptocurrency network which is had to
find unless its government institution trying to completely make it centralized
or some rich fellas like warren buffet, bill and mark. Lets take a layman example
when packing lorries which maybe sack of maize using a chain system of people
to convey to each other and maybe it takes 3 second to achieve the change to
pass it from the guy behind you to the guy in front of you and one time it
takes 6 seconds because one person did not pass the sack instead stole the
whole system would know this is how its simply works but know you are adding
transactions to a ledger where all transactions from the first change to date.
No wander some wallets would tell you hat its would take a year or so to update
your ledger to have all entries or maybe 5 years. Thus you have a decentralized
network of people with proof of work. Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking
officer has stated “widespread use of cryptocurrency would also make it
more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on economic activity,
which are used by governments to steer the economy”. He cautioned that virtual
currencies pose a new challenge to central banks' control over the important
functions of monetary and exchange rate policy. So we would eventually be
untraceable by the government that want to control us. This is why many
governments aren't implementing the cryptocurrency and calling it a pyramid
scheme. They then can not tax you. In cryptocurrency networks, _mining_ is a
validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new
cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating
a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network.
The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased
by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex
hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt

## Let it be so latin for fiat

Corruption is the abuse of power by a public official for private gain or any
organized, interdependent system in which part of the system is either not
performing duties it was originally intended to, or performing them in an
improper way, to the detriment of the system's original purpose. The abuse of
public offices for private gain is paradigmatic of corruption.

Which one would you consider a new school of leadership that does not seek
validation from the halls of power?

Are you ready to hold elected officials accountable?
