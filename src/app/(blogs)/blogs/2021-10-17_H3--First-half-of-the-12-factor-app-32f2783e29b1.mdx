#### The previous blog is at: [H2: IoT hardware for a 12-factor application](/blogs/2021-10-15_H2--IoT-hardware-for-a-12-factor-application-48b6d16eff17)

### Introduction

Many businesses wish to avoid relying solely on third-party technologies, and
it may be helpful to examine the ideas that underpin an application design. It
will also assist you in evaluating and comparing various solutions for
resolving the underlying difficulties. Heroku, as a platform on which hundreds
of millions of apps are deployed, has had to isolate the basic design
principles for cloud-based applications and provide an environment that makes
them simple to create and manage. The 12-Factor App is a manifesto that
describes these ideas.

The first part of this post walks through the first six factors and reworks a
simple Arduino IoT application with them in mind. Part 2 continues with the
remaining six factors, demonstrating how this design allows easier integration
with containerization technologies like Docker. I won't cover advanced
container orchestration, but I would recommend you give it a shot

#### 1. Codebase

Yup, üíØ GitHub.

Our
[codebase](https://github.com/JKUATSES/2021-project-hack/tree/main/Software) is
located on GitHub. If you are a software developer, chances are that you have
interacted with GitHub. I personally love Github but also have an appreciation
for Gitlab. Initially, I was using Gitlab for CI-CD because they had a robust
pipeline but ü§î with the introduction of Github actions, I had to switch up.
Github makes it easy to contribute to open source. Many, if not all the
software developers have an account at GitHub. This makes the user base
increase, thus you can interact with many people's projects. Nearly every
open-source tool you'll find while scouting the internet üåê is hosted on
Github. If your project is open-source, GitHub is free to use. It also contains
a wiki and issue tracker that makes things simple and provides more extensive
documentation and feedback. To contribute, just fork a project, make your
changes, and submit a pull request via the GitHub web app or their ‚≠ï new cli.
With excellent wiki files, üìÅüìÅ you can build the documentation of your
project inside the wiki files. Their blog has guides on nearly every issue
related to git. If you can't üôÖ find it, make StackOverflow your companion
in your journey of attaining greatness. ‚ÅâÔ∏è‚úäüèÜ You can also write a
well-formatted markdown. Github actions allow you to track changes in your code
across versions. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a
version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every
üÜó iteration. If you are working on an exciting project and you need help
with software development, let us know! We would be happy to know more about
it! A codebase could be a source code store or a set of storehouses that share
a common root. The single codebase for an application is utilized to create any
number of permanent discharges that are ordained for distinctive environments.
According to Conway's law, üò± a team's organisation will eventually be
reflected in the architecture of the product the team creates. In other words,
üìì team dysfunction, poor üò• organisation, and a lack of discipline
generally lead to code dysfunction or a lack of discipline.

#### 2. Dependencies

Yup uses requirements.txt

All dependencies must be disclosed and separated clearly. A 12-factor service
never relies on system-wide packages and utilises a dependency separation
technique to prevent system-wide packages from ‚Äúleaking in‚Äù during
execution. Arduino requirement is a good example. We may utilise a virtual
environment to expressly separate the local app's environment from the global
‚Äúsite-packages‚Äù installs, which we can generate and use (source).

```cpp
#include <DNSServer.h> //https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/DNSServer
#include <WebServer.h> //https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/WebServer
#include <WiFi.h> //https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/WiFi
#include <HTTPClient.h> //https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/HTTPClient
#include <Update.h> //https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/Update
#include <WiFiManager.h> //https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager
#include <Adafruit_Sensor.h> //https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor
#include <DHT.h> //https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
#include <PubSubClient.h> //https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
#include <ArduinoJson.h> //https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
```

These are the hardware libraries we used in coming up with the hardware client.

#### 3. Config

Yup, uses .env files

Now since our board is Wi-Fi enabled, we need to store our Wi-Fi passwords and
MQTT credentials before we are ready to publish them on GitHub.

If your code likes this:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "eduroam"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "eduroam_password_#262&*("
#define MQTT_SERVER "mqtt.jkuat.ac.ke"
#define MQTT_USER "studens_email"
#define MQTT_PASS "reg_number"
```

do not share it! You'd reveal your ESSID, password, and MQTT credentials to
other people who can take advantage of your application.

Keep secrets in a separate file. Make a new file called Arduino `config.h`
with the following contents:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "eduroam"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "eduroam_password_#262&*("
#define MQTT_SERVER "mqtt.jkuat.ac.ke"
#define MQTT_USER "studens_email"
#define MQTT_PASS "reg_number"
```

We then exclude the secrets file from git using the `.gitignore` file. We add
`config.h` to `.gitignore` (create it in the root of the project if it
doesn't exist already).

Add an example for the secrets file. If you simply hide the original
`config.h`, other users who would like to reuse your code may not know what
to put inside. Create an example file named `example_config.h`. This will
contain dummy values:

```cpp
#include <config.h>
char wifiSsid[] = WIFI_SSID
char wifiPass[] = WIFI_PASSWORD
char mqttServer[] = MQTT_SERVER
char mqttUsername[] = MQTT_USER
char mqttPassword[] = MQTT_PASS
```

What if I need to develop my code in continuous integration and continuous
deployment environment?

If you wish to create your code in a Continuous environment, the entire source
code must be present, but you don't want to publish your secrets to GitHub.
So, what should you do?

Keep your secrets hidden in environment variables.
For each secret, create an environment variable in your CI (or set it directly
on your workstation if you want to build it locally):

**Alternative techniques for securely storing secrets may exist. If you have a
better one, please leave a comment.**

#### 4. Backing services

BYOBacking service

Any service the app uses via the network as part of its usual functioning is
referred to as a backing service. Databases, messaging/queuing systems, SMTP
services for outgoing email, and caching systems are all examples.

The database and other backend services are often handled by the same systems
administrators who install the app's runtime. The app may additionally
include services offered and managed by third parties in addition to locally
controlled services. SMTP services (like Postmark), metrics-gathering services
(like New Relic or Loggly), and binary asset services (like Amazon) are all
examples.

#### 1. RabbitMQ

```yaml
rabbitmq:
  build: rabbitmq/
  image: mqtt-rabbitmq
  container_name: "mqtt"
```

Sending IoT data to your backend server for processing and use by other
services is a frequent chore for developers. Using Message Queue might be one
of the solutions. RabbitMQ is a hybrid message queueing broker. It is hybrid in
the sense that it supports many protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, and WebSockets.
AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol) is a message-oriented middleware
application layer protocol that is accessible to everybody. Message
orientation, queuing, routing, dependability, and security are all
characteristics of AMQP. MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a protocol
for connecting to faraway sites with a minimal code footprint or low network
capacity. AMQP is designed with more advanced features and has more overhead
than MQTT. But in real-world application development, we may need AMQP like
reliable message queue and also has lightweight devices to work with. RabbitMQ
has the flexibility to use both protocol AMQP & MQTT together.

#### 2. InfluxDB

```yaml
influxdb:
  image: influxdb:1.7-alpine
  container_name: "influxdb"
```

Influxdb is a time-series database. Every IoT device creates time-series data,
and the demand for additional analytics is fueling the growth of these devices
and the data they generate. InfluxDB has shown its worth to some of the
world's most demanding IoT customers. The amount of data generated by IoT
devices, as well as the desire to consume it, is continuously increasing.
InfluxDB grows to collect and index huge amounts of IoT data while also
offering real-time analytics and quick query response times.

#### 3. Telegraf

```yaml
telegraf:
  image: telegraf:1.11-alpine
  container_name: "telegraf"
  depends_on:
    - rabbitmq
    - influxdb
```

Telegraf is a server agent that collects and sends metrics and events from
databases, systems, and IoT devices via a plugin-driven interface. It can
connect to data sources such as MongoDB, MySQL, gather data from your
contemporary cloud platform, container and Gather important stateful data from
IoT sensors and equipment (pressure levels, temperature levels, etc.).
Telegraf depends on rabbitmq where it fetches data from MQTT topics and
influxdb where it stores the data to the time-series database.

#### 4. Kapacitor

```yaml
kapacitor:
  image: kapacitor:1.5-alpine
  container_name: "kapacitor"
  links:
    - influxdb
```

Kapacitor is a real-time streaming data processing engine. It is
action-oriented, you can be able to plug in your machine learning models to do
anomaly detections and many more.
Kapacitor depends on influxdb from where the data is stored.

#### 5. Chronograf

```yaml
chronograf:
  image: chronograf:1.7-alpine
  container_name: "chronograf"
  links:
    # Chronograf requires network access to InfluxDB and Kapacitor
    - influxdb
    - kapacitor
  depends_on:
    - kapacitor
    - influxdb
    - telegraf
```

Chronograf lets you rapidly examine the data you've saved in InfluxDB,
allowing you to create more sophisticated searches and alerts. It's easy to
use and comes with templates and libraries to help you quickly create
dashboards with real-time data visualisations.
Chronograf depends on influxdb from where the data is stored, telegraf which
collects metrics and kapacitor from where stream processing happens.
It has to link with influxdb and kapacitor

#### 6. Grafana

```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  container_name: "grafana"
  depends_on:
    - influxdb
  links:
    - influxdb
```

Grafana is a visualisation and analytics programme that is free and open
source. It allows you to query, visualise, alert on, and study your data from
any location. It gives you the tools to transform your time-series database
(TSDB) data into stunning graphs and visualisations, in simple English.

Grafana depends on influxdb.
It has to link with influxdb too.

#### 7. Portainer

```yaml
portainer:
  image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
  container_name: portainer
```

Portainer's super-simple'opinionated' GUI makes it simple for anybody to
get up and running quickly. Platform Managers can use it to the central setup,
administer, and secure multi-cluster settings, while Developers can deploy,
manage, and debug containerized programmes without knowing anything about
Kubernetes.

#### 5. Build, release, run

Bugs. üêû Downtime. Users are enraged. Does this sound üëÇ familiar? If this
is the case, you üòä may need to reconsider your release management approach.
You can't afford to deliver half-baked releases in the fast-paced,
ever-changing world of corporate IT. Nonetheless, changes in software or its
surroundings cause an astounding 75% of problems. You must invest üîù in a
strong release management strategy to avoid costly delays and keep your
organization's operations operating. From creation and testing to deployment,
release management controls all stages of a software release. üòå When a new
product or updates to an existing product are sought, release management is
necessary. While release management methods vary and should be tailored to each
business, üë©‚Äçüíº there are five key stages to consider.

1. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make a release plan: Planning takes the most time üïê because it
   involves structuring the complete release from beginning to end. A solid
   release strategy helps keep your team üë• on schedule and guarantee that all
   standards and criteria are satisfied.

2. Release of the build: After you've finalised the release üòå strategy,
   you may begin designing and constructing the product for release. This is the
   product's real ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù based on the criteria specified in the
   release plan. After you've fixed ‚úÖ any issues that have arisen, it's time
   to put the build through real-world scenario testing. This may need numerous
   iterations. As the team üë• completes the product, it is delivered to a
   testing environment for user acceptance (typically automatically). This enables
   the team to discover any faults or difficulties that may emerge in a real-world
   scenario. As flaws are discovered, the build is returned to stage two for
   further development.

3. üìä Testing for user approval: üëè User acceptance testing, often known
   as UAT, occurs when the product's intended users are allowed to use it and
   provide comments. This is frequently done as a free beta trial online or with a
   broader number of corporate workers.

4. üïì Create a press release: This stage involves putting the finishing
   touches on the product while keeping every feedback gathered during UAT in
   mind. A final quality check by the QA team is also part of the release
   preparation process.

5. üî≥ Roll out the release The big üòÉ day has finally arrived, and this is
   where all of your team's hard work will üî• be rewarded. It's time to let
   your product loose in the wilds of live üêô production.

</p>

#### 6. Processes

Thanks, Docker!

A 12-factor application operates as one or more stateless processes that share
nothing and maybe partitioned horizontally. All data that has to be saved must
be backed up to a stateful service, which is generally a database. This means
no in-memory or local disk-based caches, as well as no sticky sessions. Instead
of demonizing or writing their own PID files, these processes should rely on
the execution environment's process management (such as Upstart).
This aspect must be taken into account right from the start, in conjunction
with the talks on antifragility, horizontal scaling, and overall application
architecture. We've already achieved this goal because the sample app
delegated all stateful persistence to a database.

It's worth noting, though, that utilising the normal Ubuntu base image for
Docker has resulted in several problems, one of which being process management
(or lack thereof). Check out base image-docker if you want to utilise a process
manager to automatically restart crashed daemons or alert a service registry or
operations team. This image provides a unit for process management and
supervision, as well as additional enhancements to basic Ubuntu for Docker use,
such as the removal of the requirement for PID files.
