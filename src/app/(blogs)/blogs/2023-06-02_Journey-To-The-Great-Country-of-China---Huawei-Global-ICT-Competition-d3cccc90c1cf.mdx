> “There is a world elsewhere” — Shakespeare

Embarking on a journey to check off an item from my bucket list has been nothing short of incredible. As I share my experiences, stories, and insights in this blog, I invite you to join me on this extraordinary quest, where dreams become reality, and life is enriched with unforgettable moments.

### How Did We Get Here?

I have always been passionate about making a difference in the healthcare field, and my project on aiding patients with cardiovascular disease was born out of that passion. The statistics were alarming, with cardiovascular diseases claiming so many lives each year. I knew I had to do something to help.

In the halls of JKUAT, our annual Tech Expo was a highly anticipated event. It provided a platform for students to showcase their projects and potentially win substantial prizes. With the hope of securing funds to further develop our project, I approached my friend Anne Kariithi, the CEO of ICMS. Together, we worked tirelessly to create a prototype that could aid cardiovascular patients.

At the Tech Expo, our hopes were high, but unfortunately, our application didn’t function as expected. Despite this setback, we were grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate our prototype. Although we didn’t win any prizes, the experience was invaluable. Anne cherished her first participation in the event and vowed to give it another shot before completing her undergraduate studies. For me, it was bittersweet, as it marked my final dance at the Tech Expo.

Months later, Mr Philip Oyier, one of the ICT teachers, approached us with an unexpected opportunity — the Huawei ICT competitions. Initially, I was sceptical, unsure if it would truly benefit us. However, we decided to give it a try, believing that there was no harm in seizing the opportunity. We registered for the competition with our cardiovascular aid product, with the regional finals four months away, providing ample time for preparation. We also added one member to the team Patrick Kisio, with a clinical medicine background.

As the Huawei national award ceremony unfolded, we watched as students from the Networking, Computing, and Cloud track celebrated their triumph at the national competition. Our patrons, Mr Philip Oyier, Vanessa Ireri, and Michael Kamu, inspired us, emphasizing that we could achieve the same if we emerged victorious at the regional finals. The prospect of a fully sponsored trip to China for the global finals became our motivation, and the baton of responsibility had been passed to us.

With the guidance of the Huawei offices and the unwavering support of Michael Kamau and Vanessa Ireri, we invested countless hours in refining our presentation. The regional competition arrived, and we confidently stood before the judges, delivering our ideas with precision. Our preparation paid off, and the judges took notice of our organization and dedication. When the results were announced, we were ecstatic to hear our names called as winners, surpassing tough competition from the Nigerian team.

We had done it. Our victory secured our ticket to China for the global finals. It was a moment of immense pride and joy, knowing that our hard work and determination had paid off. The world awaited our project, and we were ready to take on the challenge, fueled by the opportunity Huawei had bestowed upon us.

### Preparations to China

The day had finally arrived for me to embark on a journey to a foreign land. Excitement coursed through my veins as I prepared for my visa appointment. I meticulously reviewed the visa application, ensuring that I had all the necessary documents and information. The instructions were clear, and I made a mental note to arrive early on the appointment day to avoid the expected long queues and lengthy processing times. Additionally, I double-checked that I had my yellow fever vaccination certificate, a requirement for entry.

As the weekend approached, an unexpected opportunity presented itself. Huawei, in collaboration with the ICT ministry, had organized a special meeting with the esteemed Prime CS, Hon Musalia Mudavadi, at his offices. The purpose of the meeting was to wish us well on our journey and express our hopes for our success, ultimately making Kenya proud. The Prime CS spoke passionately about the government’s vision to digitize numerous services and integrate ICT throughout the governmental systems. It was evident that they had a clear goal in mind, but the exact implementation details seemed to elude them.

Listening attentively to the Prime CS’s words, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of responsibility and excitement. Being part of a generation that would witness and contribute to the digital transformation of our country was a privilege. The meeting not only reinforced my commitment to my journey but also reminded me of the larger context in which it was taking place. We were not just embarking on a personal adventure but were also carrying the hopes and aspirations of a nation that sought progress through technology.

With the encouragement and well wishes from the Prime CS, Huawei, and the ICT ministry, we set off on the journey, determined to make the most of the opportunities that awaited me. As I boarded the plane, the words of the Prime CS echoed in my mind, fueling my motivation and igniting my passion for technology and innovation. I knew that the path ahead would not be without challenges, but I was ready to embrace them and contribute to the realization of Kenya’s vision for a digitally empowered future.

The “how” may have been missing during that meeting, but as I embarked on this adventure, I vowed to become part of the solution, to bridge the gap between vision and implementation, and to pave the way for a future where technology would empower and transform the lives of Kenyans. With my heart filled with hope and determination, I eagerly awaited the destination that would unfold before me, ready to make a difference in my small way.

### China

We embarked on our journey to China on the 28th of May 2023, with a brief layover in Doha. Although our time in Doha would be elaborated on during the return flight, we continued our onward journey to China. Stepping off the plane, we were immediately greeted by sweltering heat, a stark contrast to the temperate climate of Nairobi. The weather was cloudy, yet the surface temperatures were remarkably high. Wearing a jumper seemed nonsensical in this new environment. After going through immigration, we made our way to the hotel, eager to settle in and explore.

For our first dinner in China, we were served a variety of authentic Chinese dishes. Initially, the food seemed unfamiliar and overwhelming, almost like a culture shock. Many of us found it challenging to adapt to the flavours, and some opted to eat only rice or skipped the meal altogether. It was an adjustment, but we remained open-minded and willing to embrace the culinary experiences that awaited us.

The following day began with a breakfast that offered some familiar foods from back home, bringing a sense of comfort and nostalgia. Although the second day was primarily a preparation day with no major activities, we took the opportunity to gather together and receive instructions. It was also a chance to get acquainted with the Southern African Region team, forging new connections and expanding our network of fellow tech enthusiasts. As true techies, we couldn’t resist adding more shirts to our collection, proudly representing our team.

In the evening, as the Network and Cloud teams focused on their exams, we decided to take a leisurely walk around the city. Venturing out without a translator, both in person and through apps, posed a unique challenge. We got lost a few times, but as the saying goes, “kukosa njia ndio kujua njia” (losing the way is how you learn the way). Eventually, we found our way back to the hotel just in time for supper. Surprisingly, the food had begun to grow on us. The flavours were more familiar, and we appreciated the nuanced tastes of Chinese cuisine.

As we savoured our meal, we reflected on our journey thus far. The initial struggle to adapt to the food had transformed into an appreciation for the unique flavours and culinary traditions of China. It was a reminder that stepping out of our comfort zones and embracing new experiences could lead to unexpected delights. With renewed enthusiasm, we eagerly anticipated the adventures that awaited us in the coming days, ready to immerse ourselves in the vibrant culture and technological wonders of China.

### Day 1 of The Competition

On the day of the Huawei competition, our team from Kenya arrived promptly at the impressive Huawei Campus. Although it wasn’t our turn to participate that day, we were determined to show our support to the other teams competing in the Networking and Cloud categories. As we entered the campus, we couldn’t help but marvel at its grandeur and technological sophistication. The Networking and Cloud teams headed to their designated rooms, while we found a comfortable spot in the foyer, ready to fine-tune our presentation and cheer on our fellow participants.

We knew that although we weren’t on stage that day, our presence and enthusiasm played a vital role in fostering a sense of unity among all the teams.

### Day 2 of The Competition

The day had finally arrived when all our hard work would be put to the test. The judges held our fate in their hands, and our main agenda was to stay calm and composed. As we watched other participants take the stage and defend their projects, we couldn’t help but notice the stark differences in the challenges faced by first-world and third-world countries. However, this didn’t deter us from our ambition to win the grand prize. With each passing presentation, it became increasingly evident that we had a strong chance of achieving our goal. We delivered our presentation with confidence, addressing all the questions posed by the judges. I felt a surge of happiness when one of the judges asked us a question we had prepared for in advance: “Why does the LSTM model perform poorly compared to the CNN model despite the data being time series?”

After our successful presentation, a sense of excitement filled the air, and I couldn’t wait to explore Shenzhen City. Together with my colleagues, we ventured out and navigated the subway system, feeling a sense of accomplishment as we arrived at the renowned electronics market, Huaqiangbei, without any assistance. Since it was late, we didn’t have much time for shopping, but my colleagues managed to find iPhones at relatively lower prices compared to Kenya. Eventually, we returned to the hotel, timing our arrival to coincide with other team members to avoid raising suspicion.

As we settled back into our rooms, a mix of anticipation and exhaustion washed over us. We knew that regardless of the outcome, this journey had been a transformative experience. We showcased our expertise, learned from other participants, and explored a new city. The results were yet to be announced, but we carried a sense of pride and accomplishment within us. With bated breath, we eagerly awaited the final verdict, hoping that our hard work, dedication, and well-prepared presentation would be rewarded with the ultimate prize.

### Day 3

On our free day, we made the unanimous decision to revisit Huaqiangbei, this time taking on the role of local tour guides. With great enthusiasm, we gathered everyone and boarded the metro, ready for another adventure. As we arrived at Huaqiangbei, some of us took the opportunity to withdraw money from a nearby ATM, utilizing the convenience of our VISA cards. Once we had the funds, we dispersed to explore according to our interests.

The sheer magnitude of Huaqiangbei left me astounded. It seemed like anything and everything could be found within this bustling area. Numerous malls housed a plethora of electronics shops, making it a haven for tech enthusiasts. As we immersed ourselves in the vibrant atmosphere, we not only discovered a variety of gadgets but also made new friends along the way. Before concluding our visit, I made it a point to explore the nearby HCB Museum.

Leaving Huaqiangbei, I couldn’t help but reflect on the wealth of experiences we had gained throughout our journey. From presenting our project to exploring the bustling electronics market and delving into the fascinating world of circuitry and technology, every moment had contributed to our personal growth and broadened our horizons. With memories etched in our minds, we returned to our hotel, ready to face the next phase of the competition with renewed enthusiasm and a deeper appreciation for the wonders of technology.

### Final Day of the Competition

We had the chance to visit the Huawei Xi Village & Exhibition Hall Visit. The Huawei XI Village is a hidden gem nestled amidst the picturesque landscapes of rural China. This quaint village, untouched by the rapid pace of modernization, captivated me with its serene charm and rich cultural heritage.

Upon arriving in Huawei Xi Village, I was immediately struck by its idyllic setting. Surrounded by lush green fields, and meandering rivers, the village exuded an air of tranquillity that instantly put me at ease. The traditional architecture of the houses, with their intricate woodwork and vibrant red lanterns, spoke volumes about the villagers’ deep-rooted connection to their past.

As I bid farewell to Huawei Xi Village, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the opportunity to immerse myself in its tranquil beauty and cultural richness. Huawei Xi Village truly deserves its place among the hidden treasures of China, and I am privileged to have experienced its magic firsthand.

The exhibition hall was a testament to the vast chasm that separates our current capabilities from the boundless potential of the future. The mind-bending technologies showcased in the hall highlighted the immense possibilities that lie ahead, but they also served as a humbling reminder of how much further we have to go. As I left the exhibition hall, my mind brimming with ideas and questions, I couldn’t help but feel a renewed sense of curiosity and determination. The visit had ignited a spark within me, pushing me to contribute to the ongoing journey of progress, knowing that we still have a long way to catch up.

We finally had the award ceremony where we managed to win the first prize. We didn’t get the grand prize but we live to fight for another day. Since we were travelling on the same day we hurriedly went to the airport so that we don’t miss our flight

The whole experience in China was awesome. I would recommend it to any tech person

### Doha

As our layover in Qatar began, we were filled with a mix of excitement and curiosity. Stepping off the plane, we were greeted with warm desert air that carried the promise of adventure. Armed with temporary visas, we embarked on a whirlwind exploration of the surrounding areas.

Our first stop was the National Museum of Qatar, a true marvel of architectural beauty. Its curvaceous design, inspired by the desert rose, captivated our senses. Inside, we were immersed in the rich tapestry of Qatari history and culture. From ancient artefacts to contemporary art installations, the museum offered a window into the nation’s past and present.

As we ventured through the exhibits, time seemed to melt away. The stories of Qatar’s resilience and progress unfolded before our eyes, leaving us in awe. Each section of the museum seemed to have a story of its own, and we were fortunate to witness them all.

Sadly, the moment arrived when we had to bid farewell to Qatar. With a parting shot of the stunning skyline and a heart full of memories, we boarded our flight back home. Our brief encounter with Qatar had left an indelible mark on our souls, igniting a desire to return one day and dig deeper into the treasures it held.

And so, as the plane took off, we carried the spirit of Qatar with us, forever grateful for the serendipitous layover that allowed us to discover a world within a layover.
