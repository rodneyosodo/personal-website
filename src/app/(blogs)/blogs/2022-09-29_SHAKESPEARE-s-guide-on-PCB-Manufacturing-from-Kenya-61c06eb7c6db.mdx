Shakespeare's guide on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Manufacturing from Kenya
is a comprehensive explanation of manufacturing printed circuit boards. The
guide discusses the various steps involved in the process, from the initial
design to the testing of the finished product. This guide is important because
it helps people in Kenya understand what PCB manufacturing entails and how they
can start with this process.

The PCB manufacturing process is critical for the assembly of electronic
devices and circuits. PCBs are used to support and connect electronic
components using conductive tracks, pads and features etched from copper sheets
laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.

The manufacturing process is important because it determines the quality and
reliability of the finished product. Poorly manufactured PCBs can cause
electrical shorts, signal integrity issues and intermittent failures.

### Introduction: Why is the PCB Manufacturing Process Important?

If you are an electronics enthusiast, like I am, you know that one of the
products that is close to our heart is a PCB. PCBs are just beautiful to look
at. With the different layers, you will be able to create different animations
on your PCB.

This picture paints an image of how PCBs can be turned into art. But today we
will not be talking about making art from PCBs.

There are many steps involved in the acquisition of a manufactured PCB from
China to Kenya, and today I will show you how we will be shipping one.

### What are the Steps Required in the PCB Manufacturing Process?

For our example, I will try and ship the
[TanaBoard](http://tana-board.rodneyosodo.com/). This is a development board
based on the RP2040 chip. It is designed and assembled here in Kenya and I will
show you how one can be imported.

#### 1. Create a PCB design file from a concept.

Your creativity starts to parachute as soon as your concept is turned into a
PCB design file. Reasonable PCB design is the foundation of PCB service. It is
preferable to provide your Gerber file as it is the industry standard rather
than the CAD files to prevent risks that could cause plagiarism and
misunderstandings between two parties, you (customers) and PCB manufacturers.

#### 2. Choose a dependable Chinese PCB maker or assembler.

There are many ways to assess a PCB maker or PCB assembler. Because there are
so many fabless PCB brokers and PCB manufacturers in China, I think this step
is the most difficult in the acquisition of China's PCB service. Your PCB
service is halfway complete once you've chosen a reputable PCB manufacturer.  
I would recommend [SeedStudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion.html)
followed by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) as I have worked with both. For this,
I will be going with JLCPCB as I had previously done an article using
SeeedStudio
[here](https://rodneyosodo.medium.com/what-shakespeare-can-teach-you-about-seeed-studio-pcb-manufacturing-ea300b19fd51)

#### 3. Submit your Gerber files to the PCB manufacturer.

Make sure you have an account on the website. Log in and head over to [Order Now](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote).

Upload your Gerber files and select the necessary parameters for your PCB.  
In our case, we will be using:

- Base Material - FR4
- Layers - Are generated automatically from your Gerber files
- Dimensions - Are generated automatically from your Gerber files
- PCB Qty - Depends on your quantity but choose 5
- Product Type - Industrial/Consumer electronics
- Different Design - One
- Delivery Format - Single
- PCB Thickness - 1.6mm
- PCB Color - Any of your choice
- Silkscreen - White
- Silkscreen Technology - Inkjet/Screen Printing Silkscreen
- Surface Finish - I would recommend ENIG-RoHS as it is unleaded but
  HASL(with lead) is cheaper
- Outer Copper Weight - 1oz
- Gold Fingers - No
- Confirm Production file - No
- Flying Probe Test - Fully test
- Castellated Holes - No
- Remove Order Number - Specify a location (Make sure you added
  **JLCJLCJLCJLC** on your PCB on the silkscreen)

Since we will also be assembling it ourselves you choose Order together with
Stencil. For the stencil, you can leave it as it is.

#### 4. Make the order

Save to cart the order. Then view your Cart and make the checkout.

#### 5. Shipping and billing information

We will be using [Rolling Cargo](https://rollingcargo.co.ke/) as a courier
service. DHL is expensive and FedEx takes a long to deliver your package. On
the Shipping Information change:

- Ship to Individual Customer
- First name : ÊªöÂä®Ë¥ßÁâ©Êµ∑‰º¶
- Last name : Your name in Chinese e.g ÁΩóÂæ∑Â∞ºÂ••Á¥¢Â§ö
- Country : China
- Province : Guangdong
- Sub provincial City : Guangzhou
- Street Address : ÂπøÂ∑ûÂ∏ÇÁôΩ‰∫ëÂå∫ÈáëÊ≤ôÊ¥≤‰∏∞Á¶æÂõ≠Áâ©ÊµÅË•øÂå∫ 2 Ê†ã 5
  Âè∑
- Building House Number : ÂπøÂ∑ûÂ∏ÇÁôΩ‰∫ëÂå∫ÈáëÊ≤ôÊ¥≤‰∏∞Á¶æÂõ≠Áâ©ÊµÅË•øÂå∫ 2
  Ê†ã
- Postal Code : 528248
- Cell Mobile Number : +8618826260043  
  You can change your billing information or leave it the same as the shipping
  address.  
  Choose SF Express (Within Guangdong) as your shipping method; it takes 3
  business days.

#### 6. Payment

We will take advantage of the fact that Mpesa is Global. Change to Credit Card
/ Debit Card and add your Mpesa GlobalPay details.

### How Much Does it Cost to Manufacture PCBs in China?

The PCBs now cost $11.11. You can reduce your price by not selecting stencil if
you don't need it. This will drop to $4.31.

Since our shipping is 1kg rolling cargo will charge us Ksh 1700. They usually
charge 1700 per kg below 1kg and $1.3 per kg above 1kg.

### Timeline

For green PCBs, it usually takes 1 day to complete while the others take an
extra 1 day. So that is 2 days for PCB manufacturing. Shipping within China
will take 3 business days and Shipping to Kenya will take 10‚Äì14 days. In
total, it will take approximately 3 weeks for PCBs to arrive in Kenya
