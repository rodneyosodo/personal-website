Qiskit Camp Africa is a 3-day Hackathon organized by the qiskit core team about
quantum computing using IBM's Qiskit platform. At the Camp, attendees get to
collaborate with physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians and quantum
researchers. Qiskit is an open-source used for quantum computing written in
python.The attendees get to develop applications, extend qiskit and also
contribute to qiskit.

## My Journey

I was called by Dr Agnes Mindila,a lecturer at the school of computing. She had
been informed of my interest in quantum computing by the lead JKUAT SCOSIT.
Lucky enough i had previously done some quantum computing using D-wave web
portal. I am an engineering student, that was my first stumbling block since
students from the school of computing were preferred. However,three of us were
selected, all engineering students. Dr Mindila informed us that she wanted to
start a quantum computing club in the school with the help of the IBM office.To
us,this was a dream come true since we also had the idea in mind and only
lacked the capacity to actualize it.The idea would create a platform for us to
sharpen our skills even further. She divulged to us about the Qiskit camp
Africa,she first had to be nominated before nominating.Unfortunately, one of us
lacked a passport and wasn't in a position to generate one within the given
timeline leaving only two of us.We send our emails to Dr Mindila. Sadly she
couldn't nominate the other person due to some problem.

Another stumbling block came up. I went to the South African visa application
site like 4 times everytime being unsuccessful. Luckily for me,visa was
accepted 3 days before travel date. Some guys had to wait for long and only
received theirs a day to travel. By grace I was able to go to South Africa for
the Qiskit Camp Africa 2019. The first of its kind in Africa

## Wits computing school

Unlike Kenyan Universities University of Witwatersrand has linked up with IBM
to open up a co-working space for software developers, digital artist,
engineers and many others.

The University of Witwatersrand also offered a 2 week summer school about
quantum computing prior to the Qiskit Camp. Unfortunately i wasn't able to go
since i applied late.

This was kind of a stepping stone to me. The past month i had been studying
quantum computing on my own with videos from YouTube and also notebooks in
GitHub. I was conversant with the platform which enabled me have a better
understanding of what was to happen.

## IBM research

### Hackathon

It was time to flex our muscles and prove the potential Kenya has. For me,
being part of the camp meant being a representation of the dreams , hopes and
ambitions that I had not just for myself but for my family and friends, for my
schoolmates and lecturers and for everyone who had in a prayer for me to enjoy
it. Being a part of the camp meant doing my best and living each and every
second of it.

The Camp was held at Kwa Maritane Lodge in Pilansberg National reserve. One of
the best places to hold a Hackathon.

We were oriented by the IBM-er and the gave a quick crash course. We were told
to sign up to GitHub and people to read the issues on the GitHub repository so
that they could assign themselves those that suit them.

The second day people gave pitches on the issues on the repository since they
were their ideas. We got to listen and decide for ourselves. I first chose was
Quantum data compression using quantum auto-encoders. This was because i had a
background knowledge on how auto-encoders worked. Our coach then said there
weren't any useful cases of it so we had to shift to one of his other ideas
which was Implementing and Generalizing the Quantum Natural Gradient optimizer
which was later changed to Generating Quantum Natural Finite Difference base on
how we were achieving the optimization.

Basically VQE is a hybrid quantum algorithm which has classical optimizer. So
far the best is SPSA used by IBM Q on its quantum jobs. What if we could mix
the merits of a quantum optimizer like the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimizer
and Classical optimizer like SPSA. Hence we implemented Quantum Natural Finite
Difference which is good in error robustness and requires less circuits run per
optimization step. It also converges faster than SPSA. We basically beat
IBM's best optimizer.

Some of the applications of this is to train quantum algorithms(VQE) using
gradient descent and also it may be of interest to study the relevant geometry
for density matrices

Throughout the camp, I met different people from different parts of the world.
I met different IBMers who are responsible of the Qiskit platform.
