### Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term that refers to the network of devices
that connect to each other via the internet. It involves connecting commonplace
items or things to the internet via sensors and IP addresses. Anything from
your shoes to your automobile to your coffee pot may be considered an everyday
object. Connecting these gadgets to the internet allows data and user analytics
to be extracted. The data and analytics gathered may be utilised for a variety
of purposes, including surveys, automation, alerts, and just improving user
experiences.

This project is primarily a hardware device with a hint of IoT. We have two
systems: a frontend system, which will be our hardware device, and a backend
system which will be our server. Our IoT setup will constitute an in-house
JKUAT SES development board which is based on the ESP32 WROOM chips(i.e Any
ESP32 chip can therefore be used as an alternative) and a DHT11 module as our
temperature and humidity sensor. With this, we can send temperature and
humidity data to our backend services for monitoring purposes.

For connectivity, the ESP32 chip has an in-built WIFI module that allows us to
go into production by deploying the device to homes given that most homes have
WIFI installed.

### Project Stack and Components

#### JKUAT SES development board

The schematic and the board layout of JKUAT SES development can be found
[here](https://github.com/JKUATSES/sesBoardv1). In case you are using any other
ESP32-based board, the following two schematics can be helpful.

#### ESP32 pinout

#### DHT11

To detect water vapour, the electrical resistance between two electrodes is
measured by the DHT11. A moisture-holding substrate with electrodes placed to
the surface serves as the humidity sensor component. When water vapour is
absorbed by the substrate, ions are released, increasing the conductivity
between the electrodes. The relative humidity affects the change in resistance
between the electrodes. The resistance between the electrodes reduces as the
relative humidity rises, whereas the resistance rises as the relative humidity
falls.

The DHT11 has a built-in thermistor that monitors temperature. The calibration
coefficients are stored and controlled by an IC on the device.

#### MQTT

The Internet of Things (IoT) has gone from zero to pervasive hype in a very
short period. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, or MQTT, is, I believe, one
of the most critical elements affecting the condition of IoT today.

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight messaging protocol
designed for usage in situations where clients require a minimal code footprint
and are linked to unreliable networks or networks with restricted capacity.
It's mostly utilised for M2M (machine-to-machine) communication and Internet
of Things connectivity.

MQTT was developed in 1999 by Dr Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper. The
communication method's original aim was to allow monitoring equipment in the
oil and gas sector to communicate data to remote servers.

MQTT uses a PUSH/SUBSCRIBE architecture to run on top of TCP/IP. There are two
sorts of systems in MQTT architecture: clients and brokers. The server with
which the clients communicate is known as a broker. Client messages are
received by the broker, who then forwards them to other clients. Clients
connect to the broker rather than communicating directly with one another.

When a client (known as a “publisher”) wants to spread information, it will
publish to a specific topic, and the broker will then send that information to
any customers (known as “subscribers”) that have subscribed to that subject.

Any client can be both a publisher and a subscriber. The clients are usually
unaware of each other and are only aware of the broker who acts as an
intermediary. The “pub/sub model” is a popular term for this structure.

MQTT also reduces transmissions by using a well-defined, compact message
structure. In comparison to HTTP, each message has a fixed header of only 2
bytes.

#### OTA

Instead of needing the user to connect the ESP32 to a computer via USB to
execute the update, OTA programming allows the user to update/upload new
software to the ESP32 via Wi-Fi.

When there is no physical access to the ESP module, the OTA capability comes in
handy. It helps to cut down on the time spent upgrading each ESP module during
maintenance.

One of the most useful features of OTA is that it allows a single central
location to deliver an update to many ESPs on the same network.

The only drawback is that you must include an additional OTA code with each
drawing you publish to use OTA in the next update.

**Ways To Implement OTA In ESP32**
There are two ways to implement OTA functionality in ESP32.

1. Basic OTA - Over-the-air updates are sent through Arduino IDE.
2. Web Updater OTA - Over-the-air updates are sent through a web browser.

On an OTA architecture, there are two key components:

1. The remote device is in charge of checking for updates, downloading the new
   version, and installing it on its system.
2. The cloud server is in charge of creating, delivering, and managing updates
   to linked devices.

Security is key in IoT and we would need a way to verify that the binary file
being downloaded is the correct file and not malware. This can be done by both
systems, IoT devices and the Server. In this case, we use the server and ensure
the communication is encrypted in between. This will reduce the IoT device work
while sending the work to the server.

</span>

The DHT11 has the following connecting wires:

- GND is a common ground for both the dht11 and microcontroller.
- 5 V is a positive voltage that powers the dht11.
- Control transmit data

Wiring the DHT11 to the SES development board is easy:

1. Connect the VCC pin(Red wire) to the 5V on the SES development board.
2. Connect the GND pin(Black wire) to the ground.
3. Connect the Data pin(Purple wire) to pin 15(i.e You can use any GPIO pins
   as the Data Pin)

#### Code

**Credentials**

Set the Wifi, and MQTT credentials to publish messages to the MQTT server.

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID your_wifi_ssid
#define WIFI_PASSWORD your_wifi_password
#define MQTT_SERVER your_mqtt_server_url
#define MQTT_USER your_mqtt_username
#define MQTT_PASS your_mqtt_password
```

#### Hardware integration code

Libraries

Here we import the necessary libraries we will need for our project. Some of
these libraries cannot be found in the default setup. If that is the case, you
can install them in your setup by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage
Libraries and search for the library name as follows:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <DNSServer.h>
#include <WebServer.h>
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>
#include <Update.h>
#include <WiFiManager.h>
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Adafruit_Sensor.h>
#include <DHT.h>
#include <DHT_U.h>
#include "./config.h" //contains our passwords
#include <PubSubClient.h> //For publishing messages to the MQTT Server
#include <ArduinoJson.h> //To create the payload so that we can publish it to the subscribed topics
```

**Declaration, definition and initialization**

Declare, and define variables and initialize classes.

```cpp
#define CURRENT_VERSION "1.0.0" // The current version of the firmware running
#define DOWNLOAD_URL SERVER_URL // The server url where we will get the latest firmware version
#define DHTPIN 2 // Digital pin connected to the DHT sensor
#define DHTTYPE DHT11 // DHT 11
#define LED 4 // Digital pin connected to the inbuilt LED
#define ARDUINOJSON_USE_LONG_LONG 1
#define ARDUINOJSON_USE_DOUBLE 1
WiFiClient espClient; //Initializing the WiFiClient
void setup_wifi();
void reconnect();
PubSubClient client(espClient); // Initializing the PubSubClient
WebServer server(80); // Initializing the WebServer
// functions to take care of OTA firmware update
void handleRoot();
String getDownloadUrl();
bool downloadUpdate(String);
DHT_Unified dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
int ledState = LOW; // Set the ledstate to be off at the first instance
const long interval = 1000; // This is the interval we will be using to check for a new version
unsigned long previousMillis = 0; // previous timings in milliseconds
unsigned long currentMillis; // current timings in milliseconds
bool success; // download success
```

**setup function**

```cpp
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200); // begin Serial at 115200 baud rate
    setup_wifi(); // function to setup up wifi
    espClient.setServer(mqtt_server, 1883); //Setup the MQTT server

    // Initialize device.
    dht.begin();
    Serial.println(F("DHTxx Unified Sensor Example"));
    // Print temperature sensor details.
    sensor_t sensor;
    dht.temperature().getSensor( & sensor);
    Serial.println(F(" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "));
    Serial.println(F("Temperature Sensor Present"));

    // Print humidity sensor details.dht.humidity().getSensor(&sensor);
    Serial.println(F(" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "));
    Serial.println(F("Humidity Sensor Present"));
    Serial.setDebugOutput(true); // Set debug to true in order to print more serial output
    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // Initialize the inbuilt led as an output device
    delay(3000); // Set a delay of 3 seconds (optional)
    String version = String("<p>Current Version - v") + String(CURRENT_VERSION) + String("</p>");
    Serial.println(version);
    // Setup Wifi Manager
    WiFiManager wm;
    WiFiManagerParameter versionText(version.c_str());
    wm.addParameter( & versionText);
    if (!wm.autoConnect()) {
        Serial.println("failed to connect and hit timeout");
        ESP.restart();
        delay(1000);
    }
    // Check if we need to download a new version
    String downloadUrl = getDownloadUrl();
    if (downloadUrl.length() > 0) {
        success = downloadUpdate(downloadUrl);
        if (!success) {
            Serial.println("Error updating device");
        }
    }
    server.on("/", handleRoot);

        Serial.println(F("Error reading temperature!"));
    } else {

        Serial.println(F("%"));
    }
    currentMillis = millis();
    if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= interval) {
        previousMillis = currentMillis;
        ledState = ledState == LOW ? HIGH : LOW;
        digitalWrite(4, ledState);
    }
    // Just chill
    server.handleClient();
    delay(1000);
    char msg[200];
    if (!espClient.connected()) {
        reconnect();
    }
    StaticJsonBuffer < 300 > JSONbuffer;
    JsonObject & JSONencoder = JSONbuffer.createObject();
    JSONencoder["time"] = millis();
    JSONencoder["temperature"] = event.temperature;
    JSONencoder["humidity"] = event.relative_humidity;
    char JSONmessageBuffer[100];
    JSONencoder.printTo(JSONmessageBuffer, sizeof(JSONmessageBuffer));
    Serial.println(JSONmessageBuffer);
    if (espClient.publish("dht/user_id892", JSONmessageBuffer) == true) {
        Serial.println("Success sending message");
    } else {
        Serial.println("Error sending message");
    }
    espClient.loop();
}
```

    HTTPClient http;
    String downloadUrl;
    Serial.print("[HTTP] begin…\n");
    String url = DOWNLOAD_URL;
    http.begin(url);
    Serial.print("[HTTP] GET…\n");
    // start connection and send HTTP header
    int httpCode = http.GET();
    // httpCode will be negative on error
    if (httpCode > 0) {
        // HTTP header has been send and Server response header has been handled
        Serial.printf("[HTTP] GET… code: %d\n", httpCode);
        // file found at server
        if (httpCode == HTTP_CODE_OK) {
            String payload = http.getString();
            Serial.println(payload);
            downloadUrl = payload;
        } else {
            Serial.println("Device is up to date!");
        }
    } else {

        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Setup WIFI function**

```cpp
void setup_wifi() {
    // Connecting to a WiFi network
    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        delay(500);
        Serial.print(".");
    }
    Serial.println("WiFi connected");
    Serial.println("IP address: ");
    Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}
```

**Reconnect function**

```cpp
void reconnect() {
    // Loop until we're reconnected
    Serial.println("In reconnect…");
    while (!espClient.connected()) {
        Serial.print("Attempting MQTT connection…");
        // Attempt to connect
        if (espClient.connect("SES_DHT", MQTT_USER, MQTT_PASS)) {
            Serial.println("connected");
        } else {
            Serial.print("failed, rc=");
            Serial.print(espClient.state());
            Serial.println(" try again in 5 seconds");
            delay(5000);
        }
    }
}
```

**Subscription**

How you handle the reception of data all depends on your level of expertise.
One could set up a decoy MQTT server in their local station device
and tap into the data from the open port for their own application or just
simply:

**Configure HiveMQ browser client to visualize the data in the browser**

Procedure:

1. Go to this [http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/](http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/)
   and click on connect button.
2. Add the subscription topics one for each topic the ESP32 uses.

As soon as the ESP32 client start publishing data to the one topic in our code
you should be able to see the changes in the page under the messages.

**Important**

The code provided above uses the Serial library for debugging purposes. The
whole setup will only operate with the Serial port open.
For deployment, comment out all the Serial instances in the code above.
