#### The previous blog is at: [H3: First half of the 12-factor app](/blogs/2021-10-17_H3--First-half-of-the-12-factor-app-32f2783e29b1)

### 7. Port binding

**80 & 8010**

The 12-factor application must be self-contained and bind to a port that is
provided in the environment variable. It can't rely on a web container like
tomcat or unicorn being injected; instead, it must incorporate a server like
jetty or thin. Requests from a public-facing hostname are sent through the
execution environment to the port-bound web process.
With most embedded web servers, this is a simple task. If you're already
utilising an external web server, supporting an embedded server within your
application may take extra effort.

For the frontend application, IoT application, we are binding port 80 so that
the end-user can interface with the IoT device web interface. This is so if
they want to config the WIFI username and passwords or if they want to manually
upgrade or downgrade the application version running in their device. This is
done by the following.

```app
WebServer server(80);
```

#### i. RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ nodes bind to ports (open server TCP sockets) to accept client and CLI
tool connections. Some of the available ports you can bind are:

- `5672`, `5671`: used by AMQP 0–9–1 and AMQP 1.0 clients without and with TLS

- `15672`: HTTP API clients, management UI and rabbitmqadmin (only if the
  management plugin is enabled)
- `1883`, `8883`: MQTT clients without and with TLS, if the MQTT plugin is enabled

- `15675`: MQTT-over-WebSockets clients (only if the Web MQTT plugin is enabled)

- `15692`: Prometheus metrics (only if the Prometheus plugin is enabled)

```yaml
rabbitmq:
  build: rabbitmq/
  image: mqtt-rabbitmq
  container_name: "mqtt"
  ports:
    - "15672:15672"
    - "5672:5672"
    - "1883:1883"
```

#### ii. InfluxDB

Some open ports you can bind when using the InfluxDB service are:

- `8086`: The default port that runs the InfluxDB HTTP service.
- `8088`: The default port used by the RPC service for RPC calls made by the CLI
  for backup and restore operations (influxdb backup and influxdb restore)

Disabled ports

- `2003` The default port that runs the Graphite service.
- `4242` The default port that runs the OpenTSDB service.
- `8089` The default port that runs the UDP service.

```yaml
influxdb:
  image: influxdb:1.7-alpine
  container_name: "influxdb"
  ports:
    # The API for InfluxDB is served on port 8086
    - "8086:8086"
    - "8082:8082"
```

# UDP Port

- `8089:8089/udp`y

#### iii. Kapacitor

Kapacitor exposes port 9092 which is the API port for the service.

```yaml
kapacitor:
  image: kapacitor:1.5-alpine
  container_name: "kapacitor"
  ports:
    # The API for Kapacitor is served on port 9092
    - "9092:9092"
```

#### iv. Chronograf

Chronograf has a WebUI port which is `8888`. If you want to visualise your
data you bind that port and open it when the application is running

```yaml
chronograf:
  image: chronograf:1.7-alpine
  container_name: "chronograf"
  ports:
    # The WebUI for Chronograf is served on port 8888
    - "8888:8888"
```

#### v. Grafana

Grafana has a WebUI port which is `3000`. If you want to visualise your data
you bind that port and open it when the application is running

```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  container_name: "grafana"
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
```

#### vi. Portainer

Portainer has a WebUI port which is `8000` and `9443`. One of them is HTTPS
while the other is HTTP. If you want to visualise your data you bind that port
and open it when the application is running

```yaml
portainer:
  image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
  container_name: portainer
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"
    - "9443:9443"
```

#### vii. Kibana

Kibana has a WebUI port which is `5601`. If you want to visualise your data
you bind that port and open it when the application is running

```yaml
kibana:
  build: kibana/
  container_name: "kibana"
  ports:
    - "5601:5601"
```

#### viii. Logstash

```yaml
logstash:
  build: logstash/
  container_name: "logstash"
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"
```

#### ix. Elasticsearch

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  build: elasticsearch/
  container_name: "elasticsearch"
  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
    - "9300:9300"
```

#### x. Nginx

Nginx exposes port `80` you have to bind it to another port so that you can serve
those requests through it.

```yaml
nginx:
  image: nginx:latest
  container_name: "nginx"
  ports:
    - "8080:80"
```

### 8. Concurrency

Keep your sessions in Redis or DB

Because a 12-factor solely employs stateless processes, it may expand out by
adding processes. A 12-factor application can contain several process types,
such as browser processes, background worker processes, or clock processes (for
cron-like scheduled activities) (for cron-like scheduled jobs).
As each process type is scaled separately, each logical process would become
its own Docker container as well. We've previously seen developing a web
process; other processes are pretty similar. Scaling out usually only entails
deploying new instances of the container. (However, scaling out the clock
processes is typically not recommended because they frequently create events
that you want to be scheduled as singletons inside your infrastructure.)

### 9. Disposability

Thank Docker and Makefile!

Processes in a 12-factor app can be launched or halted (with a SIGTERM) at any
moment. As a result, reducing starting time and gracefully shutting down is
critical. When a web service receives a SIGTERM, for example, it should cease
listening on the HTTP port, wait for in-flight requests to complete, and then
depart. Processes should be resistant to an unexpected death in the same way;
for example, worker processes should have a robust queuing backend.
You should choose a web server that can gracefully shut down. This is one of
the more difficult aspects of choosing a web server, at least for many of the
popular Python HTTP servers I've tested.

```make
GH_REPO = https://github.com/JKUATSES/2021-project-hack.git
C_DIR = chronograf/
I_DIR = influxdb/
K_DIR = kapacitor/
G_DIR = grafana/

clean: stop remove-files

all: clean pull build start

# This pull the images for the docker images
pull:
    docker-compose pull
# This builds any images which are supposed to be built while running docker compose
build:
    docker-compose build
# This starts up the containers. We change the read and write rights for the rabbitmq file the start it up
start:
    chmod 755 rabbitmq/cluster-entrypoint.sh
    docker-compose up -d
# This stops the containers while maintaining their volumes
stop:
    docker-compose down
# This prunes the images containers, volumes and networks. It also removes the data files that were created when the docker containers spun up into existence
remove-files:
    docker system prune -a
    docker volume prune
    [ -d $(C_DIR) ] && echo exists && rm -rf $(C_DIR) $(I_DIR) $(K_DIR) || echo not exists

# This watches the conatiner logs
logs:
    watch docker-compose logs
# Removes the data bases and creates new directories
clear_db:
    sudo rm -rf $(C_DIR)/data $(G_DIR)/data $(G_DIR)/provisioning $(I_DIR)/data $(K_DIR)/data elasticsearch/data logstash/data kibana/data
    mkdir $(K_DIR)/data $(C_DIR)/data $(I_DIR)/data elasticsearch/data logstash/data kibana/data
```

### 10. Dev/Prod parity

Yup
The goal of a 12-factor app is to reduce the gap between development and
production as short as possible. The amount of time code spends in development
but not in production is reduced with continuous deployment. Developers can
deploy their code in production, just as they do in their local development
environments, using a self-serve platform. Using the same underpinning services
(databases, caches, queues, etc) in development as production lowers the number
of minor issues that emerge in discrepancies across technologies or
integrations.

</span>

### 11. Logs

Yup
Consider logs to be a continuous stream of time-ordered events gathered from
all active processes and services. A 12-factor app is unconcerned with how its
output is processed. It just publishes its output to the stdout stream instead.
This output is collected, collated, and routed to its eventual destination by
the execution environment (s).
Most logging frameworks enable logging to stderr/stdout by default or provide a
simple way to switch from file-based logging to one of these streams. The
execution environment of a 12-factor programme is required to capture these
streams and manage them as the platform mandates.

Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana are the three open-source tools that make
up the ELK Stack. The ELK stack offers centralised logging to help discover
server or application issues. It allows you to search through all of your logs
in one location. It also aids in the discovery of faults across several servers
by linking logs during a specified period.

The letter E stands for ElasticSearch, which is a log storage system.
The letter L stands for LogStash, which is utilised for both transporting and
processing and storing logs.
Kibana (pronounced “kibana”) is a visualisation tool (a web interface) that
runs on Nginx or Apache.

### 12. Admin Processes

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

Any 12-factor app administration or management activities should be executed as
one-off processes within the deployment's execution environment. This process
runs against a release and utilises the same codebase and configurations as any
other process in that release, as well as the same dependency isolation methods
as the long-running processes.
This is a characteristic of the execution environment in which your programme
runs. This may be simple if you're using a Docker-like containerized
solution.
We will be using portainer to manage our Admin processes
