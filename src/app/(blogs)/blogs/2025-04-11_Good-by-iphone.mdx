title: A Change of Scenery Goodbye iPhone, Hello Android

After nearly nine years, I’ve finally made the switch. In that time, I’ve only owned two iPhones—the 6 and the 11. That alone says a lot about the longevity of Apple hardware and just how much value you can squeeze out of a single device. I held off switching for years—not because of some deep loyalty, but because there just wasn’t a strong enough reason to. The phones held their value, performed well, and didn’t actively get in my way.

But of course, [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) crept in. I replaced several batteries, lived with the frustration of tiny storage, and occasionally had to delete photos to make room. Apple famously says, [“8 GB of RAM is equal to 16 GB on competition's models.”](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/) But does that philosophy extend to storage too? I doubt it. This isn’t a rant about the Apple ecosystem—Apple still makes excellent hardware and pretty solid software. But sometimes, falling in love with something new is easier (and healthier) than holding onto something old.

Lately, though, it’s Apple’s control that’s been bothering me the most. If an app isn’t on the App Store, I simply can’t run it—even though I paid for the device. Why? It’s my phone. I’m not leasing it. Why can’t I install what I want?

Then there’s the never-ending saga of Apple vs. everyone else. From [Spotify](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-spotify-2-billion-fine-eu/) to [Epic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/17/epic-games-vs-apple-vs-google-australia-lawsuits-alleged-market-power), Apple continues to strong-arm developers with its App Store commission and arbitrary rules about how apps communicate with users. Does Apple take a commision of your Uber fare? Of course not. But somehow, a developer offering a subscription-based service gets taxed.

Let’s not forget the Lightning cable nonsense. It took EU intervention to get [USB-C](https://commission.europa.eu/news/eu-common-charger-rules-power-all-your-devices-single-charger-2024-12-28_en) on the iPhone, even though it’s now the universal standard—from microcontrollers and laptops to flagship smartphones. Apple clung to its proprietary connector for far too long. And while we’re at it: data transfer speeds? Charging? The Lightning port should’ve been retired years ago.

And now, [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/). I don’t want generative AI integrated into my phone or computer. Especially not the kind I can’t opt out of.

So, last week, I made the switch—to a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

I seriously considered a Pixel device, mainly for its support for custom OSes like [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), a security- and privacy-focused alternative based on Android. Don’t get me wrong—Google is no less of a corporate behemoth than Apple. Both are intent on extracting rent from their app ecosystems. But Android's openness? That part is real.

Ironically, the seed for this switch was planted last year during a casual conversation. My boss pulled out the S25 Ultra and started sketching with the S Pen while explaining a concept to me. It was such a slick, natural moment—and yeah, a bit of a flex. Ever since then, I knew I wanted a device like that. Not just for the S Pen, but for the versatility.

What I want from Android is the same longevity I got from my iPhone—plus a bit more freedom. Thankfully, the Android ecosystem has matured. Performance is no longer a compromise. With this phone, I feel like I’m gaining more than I’m giving up: faster chip, more RAM and storage, better cameras, fair-quality video, faster charging, stronger network reception. It’s not a downgrade. It’s an upgrade.

That’s what a change of scenery can do—shake you out of your default mode and open your eyes to what else is out there. Sometimes, that’s all it takes to discover new tools, new workflows, even new ways of thinking. And that’s a gift in itself.

The transition wasn’t without hiccups. Most of my data transferred seamlessly, but some of my WhatsApp chats didn’t make it over. If only WhatsApp allowed direct backup to an S3-compatible service, this could’ve been avoided. On the bright side, I’d already left Google Photos a year ago and now happily self-host my photo library using [Immich](https://immich.app/). No regrets there.

At the end of the day, a phone is just a tool—but the right tool can empower you, not just serve you. I'm not here to convince anyone to switch sides. But if you've ever felt boxed in, maybe it's time to look over the fence. You might just find that the grass isn’t greener—it’s just less fenced.
