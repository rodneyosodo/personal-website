Integrating large language models (LLMs) within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
represents a groundbreaking advancement in secure and confidential AI deployment.
By leveraging TEEs such as AMD SEV-SNP, which provide robust attestation mechanisms
to verify the integrity of models and data, sensitive AI workloads can be executed
in isolated, hardware-protected environments. This fusion of confidential computing
and AI ensures the scalability, security, and privacy required for next-generation applications.
Supporting this vision, frameworks like SuperMQ — a modern, scalable, and
secure cloud platform for messaging and event-driven architectures — offer
critical infrastructure for real-time event processing and user management,
enabling robust and trustworthy AI solutions.

### Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

A large language model (LLM) is a statistical language model trained on a
massive amount of data capable of language generation and other natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. LLMs are trained using deep learning
techniques, especially the [transformer model architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

</span>

The transformer model architecture is a type of neural network architecture
that is well-suited for processing sequential data, such as natural language
text. Before the Transformer, most models for things like language translation
used:

- [Recurrent Neural Networks](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Recurrent_neural_networks)
  (RNNs): These models process words one by one, which makes them slow because
  each word depends on the one before it.
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://hal.science/hal-04206682/document)
  (CNNs): These work faster, but aren't great at understanding long sentences
  because they focus only on small chunks at a time.

Both models typically have two parts:

- Encoder: Understands the input (like a sentence in one language).
- Decoder: Translates this understanding into an output (like a sentence in
  another language).

To improve these models, people added something called **attention**. This
helps the model focus on the most important words when translating or
processing text. The Transformer model changed things by using only attention
to process sequences of text. It doesn't use RNNs or CNNs at all. Here's
how it's different:

- No Recurrence: Instead of processing one word at a time like RNNs, the
  Transformer looks at the entire sentence at once. This makes it much faster.
- Attention Everywhere: The Transformer uses multiple layers of attention to
  understand how every word relates to every other word in a sentence, which
  helps it make better predictions.

In simple terms, a Large Language Model (LLM) is a computer program that learns
to understand and interpret human language or other complex data by being
exposed to many examples. These models are often trained on massive amounts of
text, sometimes gathered from the internet. However, the quality of the data
affects how well the LLM learns, so developers may choose to use carefully
selected data sets to improve the model's ability to understand language
naturally.

LLMs can be trained to perform various tasks. One of the most popular uses is
[generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence), where,
given a prompt or question, they can produce text as a response. For example,
ChatGPT, a widely available LLM, can generate essays, poems, and other forms of
writing based on user inputs. Examples of LLMs include
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (OpenAI), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
(Google), [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) (Meta), and many others. [GitHub's Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is another example, but it
focuses on helping with code rather than natural language.

### The Role of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in AI Workloads

Confidential computing is a technology designed to protect computer workloads
from their surrounding environments. It addresses a critical and previously
unresolved issue: how to process data on computing infrastructure that may be
compromised.

The foundation of confidential computing lies in specialized hardware. The
processor creates a secure environment for data processing, often referred to
as a trusted execution environment (TEE). Generally, a TEE is responsible for
running and securing a single workload, such as a function, application, or
container. For instance, in Intel SGX, TEE is synonymous with an enclave, while
for AMD SEV, Arm CCA, and Intel TDX, TEE refers to a confidential VM
([CVM](https://profian.com/what-are-confidential-vms/)).
[AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html) is a
technology that isolates and encrypts the memory of a VM, providing a high
level of security for the VM. AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested
Paging (SEV-SNP) enhances security by providing strong memory integrity
protection to guard against malicious hypervisor-based attacks, including data
replay and memory remapping. This technology establishes an isolated execution
environment for virtual machines (VMs). Furthermore, SEV-SNP includes several
optional security features that accommodate a broader range of VM use cases,
bolster protection against interrupt-related vulnerabilities, and improve
defences against recently identified side-channel attacks.

Running AI workloads in TEEs is a critical step in achieving confidential
computing. This ensures that data and AI models are protected from unauthorized
access outside the TEE. TEEs provide a higher level of security for trusted
applications running on the device. In Cube AI, the TEE ensures that AI models
are executed securely and in a controlled environment. The user can verify the
integrity of the AI model running inside by doing remote attestation. Remote
attestation is a process that proves to the user that SEV protection is in
place and that the virtual machine is not subject to manipulation. Before
sending secrets to the CVM, the user must verify the attestation information.
While this process is the same for the SEV and the SEV-ES, it changed with the
SEV-SNP.

  Figure 2: SEV-SNP Attestation From
  [virtee](https://github.com/virtee/snpguest)
</span>

In SEV-SNP, the attestation process involves the same parties as SEV versions
but introduces two new keys for signing attestation reports: the Versioned Chip
Endorsement Key (VCEK) and the Versioned Loaded Endorsement Key (VLEK).

- **VCEK**: This is a unique private key created by hashing the CEK key with
  the version numbers of all the trusted computing base (TCB) components,
  including the CPU microcode, SNP firmware, PSP operating system, and PSP
  bootloader. The VCEK is signed with the ASK and ARK keys to validate the
  attestation report.

- **VLEK**: This key can replace the VCEK when signing the attestation report.
  The VLEK is an ECDSA P-384 key signed by AMD. Unlike the VCEK, which is unique
  to each chip, the VLEK requires the platform owner (PO) to enrol with AMD and
  obtain a unique seed from the AMD Key Derivation Service (KDS). To do this, the
  PO must provide the KDS with the current TCB version and the processor's chip
  ID. The KDS then creates a VLEK hashstick, which is wrapped in an AES-256-GCM
  key derived from the chip ID. Once loaded, the firmware can use the VLEK
  instead of the VCEK.

The **ID block** can be given to the PO by the Global Orchestrator (GO) and is
presented to the hypervisor during the launch of the Confidential Virtual
Machine (CVM). This ID block includes the expected launch measurement, the GO
policy, and its cryptographic signature. If the measurement doesn't match the
expected value, the CVM launch will fail. The GO also provides the public ID
key to the hypervisor for verification.

The **guest policy** in SEV-SNP serves a similar purpose to previous SEV
versions. It includes flags that determine how the CVM should start, such as
debug options and firmware version requirements.

A key change in SEV-SNP is how the attestation report is retrieved and sent to
the GO. This report is accessed using a kernel driver (sev-guest driver) that
interacts with the SNP firmware. The driver communicates with the firmware by
sending encrypted messages through the hypervisor using VM platform
communication keys (VMPCKs). During the CVM launch, a special memory page
containing these keys is created. If a message requests an attestation report,
the firmware sends it back to the hypervisor and then to the guest.

The main components of the SEV-SNP attestation report include the CVM
measurement, the GO policy, TCB information, the digest of the ID key that
signed the ID block, and data from the guest. This report data is a 512-bit
block that the firmware does not modify, allowing it to carry important
information to the GO, like a public key for establishing a secure connection.
Once the GO receives the attestation report, it verifies the signature and
checks the validity of the information.

On an already enabled SEV-SNP system, the attestation report can be retrieved
by running the following command:

```bash
snpguest report attestation-report.bin request-data.txt - random
```

This command will request the attestation report.
`attestation-report.bin` is the output file that will contain the
report. `request-data.txt` is a file that contains the request data.

AMD Root Key (ARK) and AMS SEV Key (ASK) are requested from the AMD Key
Derivation Service (KDS).

```bash
snpguest fetch vcek pem milan . attestation-report.bin
```

**Milan** is the AMD processor model.

AMD VCEK is requested from the AMD Key Derivation Service (KDS).

```bash
snpguest fetch vcek pem milan . attestation-report.bin
```

The certificates are then verified.

```bash
snpguest verify certs .
```

The attestation report is verified.

```bash
snpguest verify attestation . attestation-report.bin
```

To get the measurement from the attestation report, run the following command:

```bash
snpguest_report_measurement=$(snpguest display report attestation-report.bin | tr '\n' ' ' | sed "s|.*Measurement:\(.*\)Host Data.*|\1\n|g" | sed "s| ||g")
snpguest_report_measurement=$(echo ${snpguest_report_measurement} | sed $'s/[^[:print:]\t]//g')
echo -e "Measurement from SNP Attestation Report: ${snpguest_report_measurement}\n"
```

The expected measurement and actual measurement are compared to ensure that the
attestation report is valid.

### SuperMQ

SuperMQ is a cutting-edge event-driven infrastructure solution designed to
empower organizations and developers in building secure, scalable, and
innovative cloud applications. SuperMQ provides a platform for building SaaS
applications that leverage the power of TEEs to protect sensitive data and AI
models. It offers fine-grained control over user permissions, taking into
account hierarchical relationships between entities and domains. The structure
and functionality of the authorization system are implemented using
[SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb) - based on [Google
Zanzibar](https://zanzibar.academy/) protocol - and its associated schema
language. The **Auth** service backed by SpiceDB manages permissions for users
and domains. By striping SuperMQ of protocol adapters, it allows for the
building of a custom **user management platform** using its
[Auth](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/tree/main/auth) and
[Users](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/tree/main/users) services.

### Ollama: Simplifying LLM Integration

Ollama is a popular open-source tool for running LLMs. Ollama bundles model
weights, configurations, and datasets into a unified package managed by a Model
file. Ollama supports a variety of LLMs including Llama, Phi, Gemma, Mistral
and many others. Ollama also supports the creation and use of custom models.
You can create a model using a Modelfile, which includes passing the model
file, creating various layers, writing the weights, and finally, seeing a
success message. For more information about Ollama, please refer to the [Github repository](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).

Running models using Ollama is a simple process. Users can download and run
models using the run command in the terminal. If the model is not installed,
Ollama will automatically download it first. For example, to run the llama3.2
model, you would use the command

```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

To use Ollama as a coding assistant, we would need 4 models.

- Chat model - is designed to engage in conversational exchanges. These
  models are generally capable of answering a wide range of questions and
  producing intricate code, making the most effective ones typically large, often
  exceeding 405 billion parameters. For example `llama3.2` or `gemma2`
- The autocomplete model - is trained using a specialized format known as
  fill-in-the-middle. This format involves providing the prefix and suffix of a
  code file and predicting the content that fits in between. This specific task
  allows for smaller models to perform effectively, with even a 3 billion
  parameter model yielding good results. Conversely, this specialization means
  that larger chat models may not perform as well in this context. For example
  `starcoder2` or `codegemma`
- The embeddings model - is designed to transform a piece of text into a
  vector, enabling quick comparisons with other vectors to assess the similarity
  between different text segments. These models are usually much smaller than
  large language models (LLMs) and are significantly faster and more
  cost-effective. For example `nomic-embed-text` or `mxbai-embed-large`
- reranking model - is trained to evaluate two pieces of
  text - typically a user question and a document - and assign a
  relevancy score between 0 and 1, indicating how useful the document is for
  answering the question. Reranking models are generally much smaller than large
  language models (LLMs) and are significantly faster and more cost-effective.

### Cube AI

Cube AI is a platform for interacting with GPT-based AI applications using
confidential computing. It protects user data and the AI model by using a TEE.

#### Key Features

- **Secure Computing**: Cube AI uses secure enclaves to protect user data and
  AI models from unauthorized access.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Cube AI uses a TEE to ensure that AI
  models are executed securely and in a controlled environment.
- **Scalability**: Cube AI can handle large amounts of data and AI models,
  making it suitable for applications that require high performance and
  scalability.

#### Why Cube AI?

Traditional GPT-based AI applications often rely on public cloud services,
which can be vulnerable to security breaches and unauthorized access. The
tenant - the 3rd party company running LLM server for you— and the
hardware provider - a public cloud provider on which the server is
deployed - are not always transparent about their security practices and
can be easily compromised. They can also access your prompts and model
responses. Cube AI addresses these privacy concerns by using TEEs. Using TEEs,
Cube AI ensures that user data and AI models are protected from unauthorized
access outside the TEE. This helps to maintain user privacy and ensures that AI
models are used in a controlled and secure manner.

#### How does Cube AI work?

Cube AI uses TEEs to protect user data and AI models from unauthorized access.
TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security for
trusted applications running on the device. In Cube AI, the TEE ensures that AI
models are executed securely and in a controlled environment.

Cube AI is built on top of SuperMQ, Ollama and a custom proxy server. All these
hosts the Cube AI API that hosts the AI models and protects prompts and user
data securely.

<span className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 italic block">
  Figure 3: Cube AI Architecture
</span>

Cube AI uses SuperMQ Users and Auth Service to manage users and authentication
and authorization. Since SuperMQ is based on micro-service architecture, auth
and users are separated from the core application. SuperMQ is responsible for
user authentication, authorization and user management. It also provides a
secure way to store user data.

Ollama is responsible for managing LLMs and their configurations. It provides a
unified interface for interacting with different LLMs. Ollama also provides a
way to manage LLMs, including configuring LLMs, managing prompts, and managing
models.

The proxy server is responsible for handling requests to ollama. Once a user is
registered on SuperMQ and issued with an access token, the user can interact
with Cube AI using the issued token. The proxy server will verify the token and
ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the Cube AI API by
checking it with the SuperMQ Auth Service. Once the request is verified, the
proxy server will forward the request to the appropriate Ollama instance. The
proxy server also handles authentication and authorization for the user. It
ensures that only authorized users can access the Cube AI API.

Cube AI uses a Hardware Abstraction Layer(HAL) and AMD SEV-SNP as an
abstraction layer for confidential computing. AMD SEV-SNP creates CVMS. CVMs
are usually used to run an operating system (e.g., Ubuntu and its
applications). To avoid using a whole OS, HAL uses:

- Linux kernel v6.11 - _vmlinuz_ archive with the standard Linux kernel
  v6.11 with support for AMD SEV.
- File system - the initial RAM file system (_initramfs_) that is used as
  the root file system of the VM and extra ext4 filesystem for persistent data
  storage for docker images and other data.

HAL is made using the tool [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/). Buildroot is
used to create efficient, embedded Linux systems, and we use it to create the
compressed image of the kernel (_vmlinuz_) and the initial file system
(_initramfs_). HAL configuration for Buildroot also includes Docker runtime and
[snp-guest](https://github.com/virtee/snpguest) software support.

Cube AI uses Qemu and Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) to boot the CVM.
During boot with SEV-SNP, the AMD Secure Processor (AMD SP) measures
(calculates the hash) of the contents of the VM to insert that hash into the
attestation report. This measurement is proof of what is currently running
inside the VM.

### Conclusion

Running LLMs within TEEs like AMD SEV-SNP presents both challenges and
opportunities. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the execution of these
computationally intensive models remains secure while maintaining performance
efficiency. TEEs, while excellent at protecting data and models from
unauthorized access, can introduce latency or require significant hardware
resources, which may slow down the execution of complex models. Additionally,
the verification and attestation processes needed for confidential computing
can increase the complexity of deployment and operations.

A significant challenge in scaling LLMs within TEEs is the reliance on
high-performance GPUs that support TEEs. Currently, NVIDIA's H100 GPUs are
among the few that provide confidential computing capabilities, offering
hardware-level security for AI workloads. However, H100 GPUs are not only rare
but also prohibitively expensive, making them difficult to obtain for smaller
organizations or projects. This limits the accessibility of secure GPU
resources for deploying large-scale AI models in confidential environments,
adding another layer of difficulty for those looking to adopt confidential
computing for LLMs.

The fusion of LLMs and secure execution environments represents a significant
step forward for both AI and cybersecurity. By addressing the technical
challenges, such as hardware availability, and continuously improving upon
frameworks like SuperMQ and Ollama, we can unlock the full potential of LLMs
while ensuring data privacy, integrity, and security in a confidential
computing world.
