In the ever-evolving software development landscape, adaptability and
extensibility are key virtues. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just
starting your coding journey, harnessing the power of Go's interfaces can
significantly enhance your ability to build flexible and extensible programs.
In this blog, we embark on a journey through the intricacies of Go's
interface system, uncovering the secrets that enable you to create versatile
and robust software solutions. Join us as we dig deep into the world of Go and
discover how interfaces can be your secret weapon in crafting software that
stands the test of time.

### **Introduction**

Go is not an object-oriented language, that is known. Polymorphism is a feature
of object-oriented languages, and Go does not have classes. However, Go does
have interfaces, and interfaces are a way to achieve polymorphism in Go. An
interface is a collection of method signatures that a type can implement.
Interfaces are a way to define behaviour, and they are a powerful tool in Go.
This means you can write code that is more flexible and adaptable by using
interfaces.

#### **What is Polymorphism?**

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In
object-oriented programming, polymorphism is a feature that allows objects of
different types to be treated as the same type. In other words, polymorphism
allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word
“poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, so polymorphism means many
forms. This means that a single function or method can be used to do different
things depending on the type of data that it is acting upon.

For example, you can have a `Car` interface that has a
`drive()` method. You can then have a `lambo` and
`chevy` type that both implement the `Car` interface. The
`drive()` method for each type can be different, but the interface is
the same.

In Go, we can achieve polymorphism by using interfaces. Interfaces allow us to
define behaviour and then have types implement that behaviour. This means that
we can have multiple implementations of the same behaviour. This is
polymorphism.

Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// car is an interface that defines the methods that all cars must have
type car interface {
    // drive method is used to move the car
    drive()

    // stop method is used to stop the car
    stop()
}

type lambo struct {
    Model string
}

type chevy struct {
    Model string
}

var (
    _ car = (*lambo)(nil)
    _ car = (*chevy)(nil)
)

func (l *lambo) drive() {
    fmt.Printf("Lambo of model %s on the move\n", l.Model)
}

func (l *lambo) stop() {
    fmt.Printf("Lambo of model %s stopped\n", l.Model)
}

func (c *chevy) drive() {
    fmt.Printf("Chevy of model %s on the move\n", c.Model)
}

func (c *chevy) stop() {
    fmt.Printf("Chevy of model %s stopped\n", c.Model)
}

// driveCar is a function that takes a car interface and calls the drive method
func driveCar(c car) {
    c.drive()
}

// stopCar is a function that takes a car interface and calls the stop method
func stopCar(c car) {
    c.stop()
}

func main() {
    var l = lambo{
        Model: "Gallardo",
    }
    var c = chevy{
        Model: "Camaro",
    }
    driveCar(&l)
    driveCar(&c)
    stopCar(&l)
    stopCar(&c)
}
```

Output

```bash
go run interfaces/basic/main.go

Lambo of model Gallardo on the move
Chevy of model Camaro on the move
Lambo of model Gallardo stopped
Chevy of model Camaro stopped
```

In the above example, we have a `car` interface that defines the
`drive()` and `stop()` methods. Any type that implements these
two methods can be considered a `car`. We then have two types
`lambo` and `chevy` that both implement the `car`
interface. This means that both types have the same behaviour, but the
implementation of that behaviour is different. They both have a field called
Model which stores the model name of the car. We then have two functions
`driveCar()` and `stopCar()` that take a `Car`
interface as an argument. This means that we can pass in either a
`lambo` or `chevy` type to these functions. The main function
creates a `lambo` and `chevy` type and then calls the
`driveCar()` and `stopCar()` functions with each type. This
means that the same function is being used to drive and stop both types, even
though the implementation of the `drive()` and `stop()` methods
are different for each type. This is polymorphism.

Interfaces can be used to define common behaviour for different types of
objects. In this case, all cars can drive and stop. This can be useful for
writing code that works with cars without having to know the specific details
of each type of car.

### **Why are Interfaces Important?**

Interfaces are important in software design because they:

- Encapsulate abstraction. An interface defines the behavior of an object, but
  not its implementation. This allows the implementation to be changed without
  affecting the clients of the interface.
- Promote loose coupling. Loose coupling is a design principle that minimizes
  the dependencies between modules. This makes the code more flexible and easier
  to maintain.
- Allow polymorphism. Polymorphism is the ability to treat objects of different
  types similarly. This is made possible by interfaces, which define a common set
  of methods for different types of objects.
- Make code more readable and maintainable. Interfaces can make code more
  readable and maintainable by providing a clear definition of the expected
  behaviour of an object. This makes it easier to understand how different parts
  of the code interact.

### **Interfaces following the Software Design Principles**

Software design principles are a set of guidelines that help developers create
software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. It is not a specific
implementation, but rather a description of the solution that can be used in
many different ways. Design patterns can help you write more maintainable and
extensible code, and they can also help you communicate your ideas to other
developers.

Here are some of the most common design patterns in Go:

- Singleton pattern: This pattern ensures that there is only one instance of a
  particular class in a program.
- Factory pattern: This pattern provides a way to create objects without
  specifying their concrete class.
- Adapter pattern: This pattern allows two incompatible classes to work
  together.
- Builder pattern: This pattern allows you to construct complex objects step by
  step.
- Prototype pattern: This pattern allows you to create new objects by cloning
  existing ones.

These are just a few of the many available design patterns. If you are new to
Go software design, I recommend that you learn about the most common patterns.
There are many resources available online, including books, articles, and
tutorials.

An example of using software design principles while implementing an interface:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// car is an interface that defines the methods that all cars must have
type car interface {
    // addDoors method is used to add doors to the car
    // This is an example of the Builder pattern
    addDoors(doors uint8) car
    // addEngine method is used to add an engine to the car
    // This is an example of the Builder pattern
    addEngine(engine string) car
    // drive method is used to move the car
    drive()
    // stop method is used to stop the car
    stop()
}

// lambo is a struct that represents a Lamborghini car
type lambo struct {
    doors  uint8
    engine string
}

// newLambo is a function that returns a new lambo struct
// This implements the Factory pattern
func newLambo() car {
    return &lambo{}
}

func (l *lambo) addDoors(doors uint8) car {
    l.doors = doors
    return l
}

func (l *lambo) addEngine(engine string) car {
    l.engine = engine
    return l
}

func (l *lambo) drive() {
    fmt.Println("Lambo on the move")
}

func (l *lambo) stop() {
    fmt.Println("Lambo stopped")
}

// chevy is a struct that represents a Chevrolet car
type chevy struct {
    doors  uint8
    engine string
}

// newChevy is a function that returns a new chevy struct
// This implements the Factory pattern
func newChevy() car {
    return &chevy{}
}

func (c *chevy) addDoors(doors uint8) car {
    c.doors = doors
    return c
}

func (c *chevy) addEngine(engine string) car {
    c.engine = engine
    return c
}

func (c *chevy) drive() {
    fmt.Println("Chevy on the move")
}

func (c *chevy) stop() {
    fmt.Println("Chevy stopped")
}

// factory is an interface that defines the methods that all factories must have
// This implements the Abstract Factory pattern
type factory interface {
    makeCar(car car, doors uint8, engine string) car
}

type carFactory struct{}

func (cf *carFactory) makeCar(car car, doors uint8, engine string) car {
    switch car.(type) {
    case *lambo:
        fmt.Println("Making a Lambo")
    case *chevy:
        fmt.Println("Making a Chevy")
    }

    return car.addDoors(doors).addEngine(engine)
}

// newCarFactory is a function that returns a new carFactory struct
// This implements the Factory pattern
func newCarFactory() factory {
    return &carFactory{}
}

func main() {
    var f = newCarFactory()
    var l = newLambo()
    var c = newChevy()
    f.makeCar(l, 2, "V8")
    f.makeCar(c, 4, "V6")
    l.drive()
    c.drive()
    l.stop()
    c.stop()
}
```

Output

```bash
go run interfaces/advanced/main.go

Making a Lambo
Making a Chevy
Lambo on the move
Chevy on the move
Lambo stopped
Chevy stopped
```

From the above example, we can see that we define two interfaces: `car`
and `factory`. The `car` interface defines the methods that all
cars must have, such as `addDoors()`, `addEngine()`,
`drive()`, and `stop()`. The `factory` interface
defines the methods that all factories must have, such as `makeCar()`.

The `lambo` and `chevy` structs implement the `car`
interface. They represent two different types of cars: a Lamborghini and a
Chevrolet.

The `newLambo()` and `newChevy()` functions return new
instances of the `lambo` and `chevy` structs, respectively.

The `carFactory` struct implements the `factory` interface. It
has a method called `makeCar()`, which takes a `car`, a number
of doors, and an engine as arguments. The `makeCar()` method first
prints a message indicating what kind of car is being created. Then, it calls
the `addDoors()` and `addEngine()` methods on the car to add
the specified number of doors and engines.

The `newCarFactory()` function returns a new instance of the
`carFactory` struct.

The `main()` function creates a new `carFactory` object, a new
`lambo` object, and a new `chevy` object. It then calls the
`makeCar()` method on the `carFactory` object to create a
Lamborghini with 2 doors and a V8 engine. It also calls the `makeCar()`
method to create a Chevrolet with 4 doors and a V6 engine. Finally, it calls
the `drive()` and `stop()` methods on the Lamborghini and
Chevrolet objects.

#### **Builder Pattern**

The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows you to construct complex
objects step by step. It is often used to create objects that have many
optional parameters. The builder pattern is useful when you want to create an
object that has many optional parameters. For example, you might want to create
a car that has a certain number of doors and an engine of a certain type. You
could use the builder pattern to create a car with 2 doors and a V8 engine or a
car with 4 doors and a V6 engine.

```go
func (cf *carFactory) makeCar(car car, doors uint8, engine string) car {
    return car.addDoors(doors).addEngine(engine)
}
```

#### **Abstract Factory Pattern**

The abstract factory pattern is a design pattern that allows you to create
families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is
often used to create objects that have many optional parameters. The abstract
factory pattern is useful when you want to create a family of related objects.
For example, you might want to create a family of cars that have a certain
number of doors and an engine of a certain type. You could use the abstract
factory pattern to create a family of cars with 2 doors and a V8 engine, or a
family of cars with 4 doors and a V6 engine.

```go
func (cf *carFactory) makeCar(car car, doors uint8, engine string) car {
    return car.addDoors(doors).addEngine(engine)
}

func main() {
    var f = newCarFactory()
    var l = newLambo()
    var c = newChevy()
    f.makeCar(l, 2, "V8")
    f.makeCar(c, 4, "V6")
}
```

#### **Factory Pattern**

The factory pattern is a design pattern that allows you to create objects
without specifying their concrete classes. It is often used to create objects
that have many optional parameters. The factory pattern is useful when you want
to create an object without specifying its concrete class. For example, you
might want to create a car with 2 doors and a V8 engine or a car with 4 doors
and a V6 engine.

```go
func newLambo() car {
    return &lambo{}
}

func newChevy() car {
    return &chevy{}
}

func main() {
    var l = newLambo()
    var c = newChevy()
    l.addDoors(2).addEngine("V8")
    c.addDoors(4).addEngine("V6")
}
```

In mainflux, there is a configurable message broker. That is, you can configure
mainflux to run using `NATS` or `RabbitMQ` as the message
broker. This is achieved by using the `messaging` package. The package
contains a `publisher` and `subscriber` interface. The
`publisher` interface defines the `publish()` method and the
`subscriber` interface defines the `subscribe()` method. The
`NATS` and `RabbitMQ` packages implement the
`publisher` and `subscriber` interfaces. This means that you
can use either `NATS` or `RabbitMQ` as the message broker for
mainflux.

#### **The interface**

```go
// Copyright (c) Mainflux
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

package messaging

import "context"

// Publisher specifies message publishing API.
type Publisher interface {
    // Publishes message to the stream.
    Publish(ctx context.Context, topic string, msg *Message) error

    // Close gracefully closes message publisher's connection.
    Close() error
}

// MessageHandler represents Message handler for Subscriber.
type MessageHandler interface {
    // Handle handles messages passed by underlying implementation.
    Handle(msg *Message) error

    // Cancel is used for cleanup during unsubscribing and it's optional.
    Cancel() error
}

// Subscriber specifies message subscription API.
type Subscriber interface {
    // Subscribe subscribes to the message stream and consumes messages.
    Subscribe(ctx context.Context, id, topic string, handler MessageHandler) error

    // Unsubscribe unsubscribes from the message stream and
    // stops consuming messages.
    Unsubscribe(ctx context.Context, id, topic string) error

    // Close gracefully closes message subscriber's connection.
    Close() error
}

// PubSub  represents aggregation interface for publisher and subscriber.
type PubSub interface {
    Publisher
    Subscriber
}
```

The `publisher` interface defines the `publish()` method, which
takes a context, a topic, and a message as arguments. The `subscriber`
interface defines the `subscribe()` method, which takes a context, an
id, a topic, and a message handler as arguments. The `messageHandler`
interface defines the `handle()` method, which takes a message as an
argument.

#### Publisher

The NATS publisher implements the `publisher` interface. It has a
`conn` field that stores the NATS connection. The `publish()`
method takes a context, a topic, and a message as arguments. It then marshals
the message into a byte array and publishes it to the NATS connection.

```go
func (pub *publisher) Publish(ctx context.Context, topic string, msg *messaging.Message) error {
    if topic == "" {
        return ErrEmptyTopic
    }

    data, err := proto.Marshal(msg)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    subject := fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s", chansPrefix, topic)
    if msg.Subtopic != "" {
        subject = fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s", subject, msg.Subtopic)
    }

    return pub.conn.Publish(subject, data)
}
```

The RabbitMQ publisher implements the `publisher` interface. It has a
`ch` field that stores the RabbitMQ channel. The `publish()`
method takes a context, a topic, and a message as arguments. It then marshals
the message into a byte array and publishes it to the RabbitMQ channel.

```go
func (pub *publisher) Publish(ctx context.Context, topic string, msg *messaging.Message) error {
    if topic == "" {
        return ErrEmptyTopic
    }
    data, err := proto.Marshal(msg)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    subject := fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s", chansPrefix, topic)
    if msg.Subtopic != "" {
        subject = fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s", subject, msg.Subtopic)
    }
    subject = formatTopic(subject)

    err = pub.ch.PublishWithContext(
        ctx,
        exchangeName,
        subject,
        false,
        false,
        amqp.Publishing{
            Headers:     amqp.Table{},
            ContentType: "application/octet-stream",
            AppId:       "mainflux-publisher",
            Body:        data,
        })

    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return nil
}
```

From the above examples, we can see that the `NATS` and
`RabbitMQ` publishers have different implementations, but they both
implement the `publisher` interface. This means that you can use either
`NATS` or `RabbitMQ` as the message broker for mainflux.

Their respective factory methods are as follows:

```go
func NewPublisher(url string) (messaging.Publisher, error) {
    conn, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.MaxReconnects(maxReconnects))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    ret := &publisher{
        conn: conn,
    }
    return ret, nil
}
```

The NATS publisher factory method takes a URL as an argument. It then creates a
new NATS connection and returns a new NATS publisher. The `publisher`
struct implements the `publisher` interface, so it can be used as a
publisher for mainflux.

```go
func NewPublisher(url string) (messaging.Publisher, error) {
    conn, err := amqp.Dial(url)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    ch, err := conn.Channel()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if err := ch.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, amqp.ExchangeTopic, true, false, false, false, nil); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    ret := &publisher{
        conn: conn,
        ch:   ch,
    }
    return ret, nil
}
```

The RabbitMQ publisher factory method takes a URL as an argument. It then
creates a new rabbitmq connection and channel. It also declares a new RabbitMQ
exchange. Finally, it returns a new RabbitMQ publisher. The `publisher`
struct implements the `publisher` interface, so it can be used as a
publisher for mainflux.

Mainflux uses build flags to determine which publisher to use. If the
`NATS` build flag is set, then mainflux will use the NATS publisher. If
the `RabbitMQ` build flag is set, then mainflux will use the RabbitMQ
publisher. If neither build flag is set, then mainflux will use the NATS
publisher by default. This is done by using 2 separate files:
`brokers_nats.go` and `brokers_rabbitmq.go`. The
`brokers_nats.go` file contains the nats publisher factory method and
the `brokers_rabbitmq.go` file contains the rabbitmq publisher factory
method.

```go
// Copyright (c) Mainflux
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

//go:build !rabbitmq
// +build !rabbitmq

package brokers

import (
    "log"

    mflog "github.com/mainflux/mainflux/logger"

func init() {
    log.Println("The binary was build using Nats as the message broker")
}

func NewPublisher(url string) (messaging.Publisher, error) {
    pb, err := nats.NewPublisher(url)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return pb, nil
}

func NewPubSub(url, queue string, logger mflog.Logger) (messaging.PubSub, error) {
    pb, err := nats.NewPubSub(url, queue, logger)
    if err != nil {

    }

    return pb, nil

}

func NewPublisher(url string) (messaging.Publisher, error) {
    pb, err := rabbitmq.NewPublisher(url)
    if err != nil {

    }

    return pb, nil
}

    pb, err := rabbitmq.NewPubSub(url, queue, logger)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return pb, nil
}
```

### **Conclusion**

Interfaces are a powerful tool in Go. They allow you to define behaviour and
then have types implement that behaviour. This means that you can write code
that is more flexible and adaptable by using interfaces. Interfaces are
important in software design because they encapsulate abstraction, promote
loose coupling, allow polymorphism, and make code more readable and
maintainable.
