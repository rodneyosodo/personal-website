#### The previous blog is at: [H4: Second half of the 12-factor app](/blogs/2021-10-18_H4--Second-half-of-the-12-factor-app-b77b0fde6279)

The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought with it a slew of advantages. However,
it has increased and altered risks in business and IT. Reports of hijacked
cameras hacked medical equipment and infiltrated industrial control systems
have appeared in recent years. This situation is expected to worsen when 5G
takes hold and gadgets with embedded IoT capabilities arrive. What makes IoT so
challenging is that it puts an extra layer of security on top of current
safeguards. IoT is included in almost all aspects of a business, partners and
supply chains - it encompasses firmware, operating systems, TCP/IP
stacks, network design, data security technologies, and much more.

#### [Davos](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-davos)

Davos is an FTP automation programme that searches specified host sites for
fresh files regularly. It may be set up to do a variety of things, such as
listening for particular files to exist at the host location, then downloading
and moving them if necessary. It also includes completion alerts and downstream
API calls to help move the workflow along.
We can use Davos to push the binary files where we will use to send the Over
The Air (OTA) updates to the individual IoT devices.

An alternative to this [Grav](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-grav)
is a Fast, Simple, and Flexible, file-based Web-platform.

#### [Domoticz](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-domoticz)

Domoticz is a home automation system that allows you to monitor and set various
devices such as lights, switches, and different sensors/meters like
temperature, rain, wind, UV, Electra, Gas, and Water, among others. Any mobile
device may get notifications or alerts. We can use this to configure our DHT11
sensor and any other sensor we were to use.

#### [Duckdns](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-duckdns)

Duckdns is a free service that will point a DNS (duckdns.org subdomains) to an
IP address of your choosing. The service is entirely free, and it does not
require reactivation or forum postings to be active.
If we are to open up more endpoints like our MQTT endpoint and our dashboards
so that they can be reached by a domain name, we can use this service to
configure.

#### [Healthchecks](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-healthchecks)

Healthchecks is a watchdog for your cron jobs. It's a web server that listens
for pings from your cron jobs, plus a web interface.
This can be used to ensure our services are running by being a watchdog.

#### [Syslog-ng](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-syslog-ng)

Syslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, rewrite and
correlate logs from across your infrastructure and store or route them to log
analysis tools
This can be used to read our logs files and visualize them.

#### [Wireguard](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-wireguard)

WireGuard is a user-friendly, fast, and contemporary VPN that employs
cutting-edge cryptography. Its goal is to be quicker, simpler, leaner, and more
helpful than IPsec while avoiding the huge hassle. It aspires to be
significantly faster than OpenVPN. WireGuard is a general-purpose VPN that can
be used on both embedded interfaces and supercomputers and is suitable for a
wide range of scenarios. It was first published for the Linux kernel, but it is
now available for Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, and Android. It's still in the
early stages of development, but it's already widely recognised as the most
secure, user-friendly, and straightforward VPN option available.
This can be used to ensure security when the user is getting access to his home
network using public WIFI as they can route their traffic through this
wireguard server.

#### [Exploit IoT](https://gitlab.com/expliot_framework/expliot)

This is a pentest framework like Metasploit but specialized for IoT. This can
be used to gauge the security of our systems.

#### [Other Ideas](https://github.com/nebgnahz/awesome-iot-hacks)

Some of the ideas on how to implement IoT can be found on these awesome IoT
hacks.

#### [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)

Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low power
single board computers to full servers. This can be a replacement for RabbitMQ

#### Cloud: [Google](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) and [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/?nc1=h_ls)

Allow for an extremely secure and dependable connection between your IoT app
and the devices it handles. IoT Hubs offers a cloud-based backend that can link
practically any device. With per-device authentication, built-in device
management, and scalable provisioning, you can extend your solution from the
cloud to the edge.

#### [Kong](https://konghq.com/install/)

Kong is a Microservice API Gateway for Orchestration. Kong provides a versatile
abstraction layer for managing API interactions between clients and
microservices safely. Also called an API Gateway, API middleware, or Service
Mesh in some situations. It was released as an open-source project in 2015,
with great performance and extensibility as its main objectives.
If you're developing for the web, mobile, or IoT (Internet of Things),
you'll almost certainly require some basic functionality to get your app
running. Kong may assist by acting as a gateway (or sidecar) for microservices
requests, while also offering load balancing, logging, authentication,
rate-limiting, transformations, and more via plugins.

#### [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/)

Traefik is a popular contemporary reverse proxy and load balancer that makes
microservice deployment simple. Traefik interacts with your current
infrastructure components and automatically and dynamically configures itself.

Traefik is meant to be as simple to use as possible while yet supporting big,
complicated installations in a variety of settings and protocols in public,
private, and hybrid clouds. It also includes a strong collection of middlewares
for load balancing, API gateway, orchestrator ingress, east-west service
communication, and more.

We can use it together with Let's Encrypt to ensure we have a secure MQTTS
connection with the IoT device and an HTTPS connection with our users.

#### [Istio](https://istio.io/)

Istio is an open-source service mesh that allows teams to connect, secure,
control, and watch services. It is built on Envoy and is extendable. Istio is a
collaborative effort between IBM and Google, which gave the initial components,
and Lyft, which donated Envoy to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2017.

As a result, Istio's feature set has matured and improved. Load balancing,
traffic routing, policy development, metrics, and service-to-service
authentication are all key Istio capabilities.

#### [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

For cloud-native deployments, Kubernetes has become the de-facto standard
container orchestration framework. Kubernetes has been used by development
teams to help them transition to new microservice architectures and a DevOps
culture for continuous integration and deployment.

Many organisations are undergoing digital transformations at the same time.
Their mission is to transform the way they interact with their customers,
suppliers, and partners. To update their business IT and OT systems, these
companies are utilising advances provided by technology such as IoT platforms,
big data analytics, and machine learning.
It will automate our deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
applications.
