I will demonstrate how to write a namegenerator library in Go in this blog
post. The library will generate random names from a name dataset. The dataset
is available at
[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/0.html).

### **Background**

During the development of the
[mainflux-e2e-tools](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux/tree/clients/tools/e2e) tool, I needed to generate random names. I tried to make the names as
pronounceable and readable for people as possible. I found a library that was
doing this, [goombaio-namegenerator](https://github.com/goombaio/namegenerator)
but it was not working as I expected. The dataset was quite limited, and it
produced names using nouns and adjectives. Since some of the fields were
primary keys, I needed unique names for each one. I realized I had to take
matters into my own hands as I sat there feeling stuck and frustrated. I
couldn't count on some shoddy library to complete the task for me. I put my
hands to work and started working on my name generator. It was daunting at
first. I didn't know where to begin. However, I grew more enthusiastic as I
dug deeper into the area of name-generating. Countless opportunities existed!

### **Implementation**

I looked on the internet for a dataset of names and I found one at
[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/0.html). The dataset contains 5163 names. I created a Python
script that reads the dataset and generates a Go file with a slice of names.
The script is available at
[namegenerator.py](https://github.com/0x6flab/namegenerator/blob/2b2a18bd753a57405574399a0f50b3676b3a479c/namegenerator.py). The script generates a file called
[names.go](https://github.com/0x6flab/namegenerator/blob/2b2a18bd753a57405574399a0f50b3676b3a479c/names.go) that contains a slice of names. The script is
executed using `python3`.

```bash
python3 namegenerator.py
```

**Why did I decide to pick slices over other data structures or even read the
dataset directly from the file?**

Slices are a popular data structure in Go because they provide a convenient and
efficient way to work with sequences of typed data. They are analogous to
arrays in other languages but have some unique properties that make them more
flexible and powerful [[1]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/slices-in-golang/).

When compared to reading data straight from a file, employing slices may
sometimes be more effective. Take, for instance, a scenario in which you must
locate and return a particular section of data from a file. You can find the
needed data by reading the full file into a slice and returning a new slice
that only contains the pertinent data. It's vital to keep in mind that just
reslicing a slice does not provide a duplicate of the underlying array, which
could result in the file being retained in memory even when only a small
portion of it is required.

There are some trade-offs to consider when choosing between slices and other
data structures or file reading. Slices offer flexibility and convenience, but
they might not be the best choice for all situations. When working with large
files or data that do not need to be loaded entirely into memory, reading
directly from the file might be more efficient and suitable
[[2]](https://medium.com/@victorsteven/understanding-data-structures-in-golang-f55205afdcaa).

**How do we generate random names?**

I chose to use the [math/rand](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/) package from
the standard library because I wanted an indeterministic method of generating
names. You must first have a method for producing random integers to produce a
random name from a slice of names. To produce random numbers, however, you must
seed the random number generator with a value that is probably going to vary
each time the program is executed. One approach to do this is to use the
`time.Now().UnixNano()` function to seed the generator with the current time.

Once you have a random number generator, you can use the `rand.Intn()` function
to generate a random integer between `0` and the length of the slice of names.
This integer can then be used as an index to select a random name from the
slice.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    names := []string{"Rodney", "Osodo", "David"}

    // Seed the random number generator with the current time
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

    // Generate a random integer between 0 and the length of the slice
    randomIndex := rand.Intn(len(names))

    // Select the name at the randomly generated index
    randomName := names[randomIndex]

    fmt.Println(randomName)
}
```

**Code**

```go
package namegenerator

import (
    "math/rand"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// NameGenerator is an interface for generating names.
type NameGenerator interface {
    // Generate generates a name based on gender.
    Generate() string

    // GenerateNames generates a list of names.
    GenerateNames(int) []string
}

// nameGenerator is a struct that implements NameGenerator.
type nameGenerator struct {
    gender string
}

// NewNameGenerator returns a new NameGenerator.
func NewNameGenerator(gender string) NameGenerator {
    return &nameGenerator{
        gender: gender,
    }
}

func (namegen *nameGenerator) Generate() string {
    frandom := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))
    grandom := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))

    randonFamilyName := FamilyNames[frandom.Intn(len(FamilyNames))]

    switch namegen.gender {
    case "male":
        randomMaleName := MaleNames[grandom.Intn(len(MaleNames))]

        return randomMaleName + "-" + randonFamilyName
    case "female":
        randomFemaleName := FemaleNames[grandom.Intn(len(FemaleNames))]

        return randomFemaleName + "-" + randonFamilyName
    default:
        randomName := GeneralNames[grandom.Intn(len(GeneralNames))]

        return randomName + "-" + randonFamilyName
    }
}

func (namegen *nameGenerator) GenerateNames(count int) [string {
    var waitGroup sync.WaitGroup
    names := make([]string, count)

    for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
        waitGroup.Add(1)
        go func(index int) {
            defer waitGroup.Done()
            names[index] = namegen.Generate()
        }(i)
    }

    waitGroup.Wait()

    return names
}
```

We can generate a single name by calling the `Generate()` method on the
`NameGenerator` interface. We can also generate a list of names by calling the
`GenerateNames()` method on the `NameGenerator` interface.

### **Side Notes**

**1. Adding a pre-commit hook**

A pre-commit hook is a script that executes before the commit is performed. It
can be used to verify the commit message, examine the code for problems, and
carry out any other necessary actions before the commit is made.

`pre-commit` is a Python package that is used to add a pre-commit hook. For
controlling pre-commit hooks, this package offers a command-line interface. We
use the following command to install the package:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Once the package is installed, we can use the following command to add a
pre-commit hook:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This command will create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the current
directory. This file contains the configuration for the pre-commit hook. We can
edit this file to add our pre-commit hook.

This file contains the following configuration:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
  - id: check-merge-conflict
  - id: check-yaml
  - id: end-of-file-fixer
  - id: trailing-whitespace
  - id: check-added-large-files

  - repo: https://github.com/dnephin/pre-commit-golang
    rev: v0.5.1
    hooks:
  - id: go-fmt
  - id: go-imports
  - id: no-go-testing
  - id: golangci-lint
  - id: go-unit-tests
  - id: go-build
```

**2. Adding Go-releaser**

Go-releaser is a tool that helps you release your Go projects. It automates the
process of creating a release, uploading it to GitHub, and creating a release
on GitHub. It also provides a command-line interface for managing releases.

To install Go-releaser, we use the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest
```

The configuration for Go-releaser is stored in a file called `goreleaser.yml`.
This file contains the following configuration:

```yaml
before:
  hooks:
    - go mod tidy

builds:
  - skip: true

archives:
  - format: tar.gz
    name_template: >-
      {{ .ProjectName }}_
      {{- title .Os }}_
      {{- if eq .Arch "amd64" }}x86_64
      {{- else if eq .Arch "386" }}i386
      {{- else }}{{ .Arch }}{{ end }}
      {{- if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}
    format_overrides:
      - goos: windows
        format: zip
checksum:
  name_template: "checksums.txt"
snapshot:
  name_template: "{{ incpatch .Version }}-next"
changelog:
  sort: asc
  filters:
    exclude:
      - "^docs:"
      - "^test:"
```

Once the tool is installed, we use the following command to create a release:

```bash
goreleaser release
```

Instead of this, we will be using a [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/0x6flab/namegenerator/actions/runs/4908033011) to
automate the release process.

**3. Adding a CI/CD pipeline**

**3.1. Code Coverage with Codecov**

Codecov is a tool that helps you measure code coverage. It provides a
command-line interface for measuring code coverage. It also provides a web
interface for viewing the code coverage results.

To install Codecov, we use the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/codecov/codecov-action@latest
```

The configuration for Codecov is stored in a file called `codecov.yml`. This
file contains the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Test and coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: "1.19"

      - name: Run coverage
        run: go test -mod=vendor -v --race -covermode=atomic -coverprofile cover.txt

      - name: Upload coverage reports to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          file: ./cover.txt
          flags: unittests
```

**3.2. Run Examples with GitHub Actions**

```yaml
name: Test and coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        go: ["1.19", "1.20"]

    name: Go ${{ matrix.go }} sample
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: ${{ matrix.go }}

      - run: go run examples/female/main.go

      - run: go run examples/general/main.go

      - run: go run examples/male/main.go

      - run: go run examples/multiple/main.go
```

**3.3. Run Linting with GitHub Actions**

```yaml
name: golangci-lint

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  golangci:
    name: lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: "1.19"
          cache: false

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: golangci-lint
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3
        with:
          version: v1.50.1

          # Optional: golangci-lint command line arguments.
          args: --enable-all --disable misspell --disable funlen --disable gofumpt --disable ireturn --disable cyclop --disable lll --disable gosec --disable gochecknoglobals --disable paralleltest --disable wsl --disable gocognit
```

### **Conclusion**

In the end, my name generator surpassed all of my expectations. It was able to
generate thousands of unique, human-readable names, each one more creative than
the last. And as I looked back on my journey, I realized that sometimes the
biggest challenges can lead to the greatest rewards. You can find the library
