I will demonstrate how to write a namegenerator library in Go in this blog post. The library will generate random names from a name dataset. The dataset is available at [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/0.html).

### **Background**

During the development of the [mainflux-e2e-tools](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux/tree/clients/tools/e2e) tool, I needed to generate random names. I tried to make the names as pronounceable and readable for people as possible. I found a library that was doing this, [goombaio-namegenerator](https://github.com/goombaio/namegenerator) but it was not working as I expected. The dataset was quite limited, and it produced names using nouns and adjectives. Since some of the fields were primary keys, I needed unique names for each one. I realized I had to take matters into my own hands as I sat there feeling stuck and frustrated. I couldn’t count on some shoddy library to complete the task for me. I put my hands to work and started working on my name generator. It was daunting at first. I didn’t know where to begin. However, I grew more enthusiastic as I dug deeper into the area of name-generating. Countless opportunities existed!

### **Implementation**

I looked on the internet for a dataset of names and I found one at [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/0.html). The dataset contains 5163 names. I created a Python script that reads the dataset and generates a Go file with a slice of names. The script is available at [namegenerator.py](https://github.com/0x6flab/namegenerator/blob/2b2a18bd753a57405574399a0f50b3676b3a479c/namegenerator.py). The script generates a file called [names.go](https://github.com/0x6flab/namegenerator/blob/2b2a18bd753a57405574399a0f50b3676b3a479c/names.go) that contains a slice of names. The script is executed using `python3`.

python3 namegenerator.py

**Why did I decide to pick slices over other data structures or even read the dataset directly from the file?**

Slices are a popular data structure in Go because they provide a convenient and efficient way to work with sequences of typed data. They are analogous to arrays in other languages but have some unique properties that make them more flexible and powerful [\[1\]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/slices-in-golang/).

When compared to reading data straight from a file, employing slices may sometimes be more effective. Take, for instance, a scenario in which you must locate and return a particular section of data from a file. You can find the needed data by reading the full file into a slice and returning a new slice that only contains the pertinent data. It’s vital to keep in mind that just reslicing a slice does not provide a duplicate of the underlying array, which could result in the file being retained in memory even when only a small portion of it is required.

There are some trade-offs to consider when choosing between slices and other data structures or file reading. Slices offer flexibility and convenience, but they might not be the best choice for all situations. When working with large files or data that do not need to be loaded entirely into memory, reading directly from the file might be more efficient and suitable [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@victorsteven/understanding-data-structures-in-golang-f55205afdcaa).

**How do we generate random names?**

I chose to use the [math/rand](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/) package from the standard library because I wanted an indeterministic method of generating names. You must first have a method for producing random integers to produce a random name from a slice of names. To produce random numbers, however, you must seed the random number generator with a value that is probably going to vary each time the program is executed. One approach to do this is to use the `time.Now().UnixNano()` function to seed the generator with the current time.

Once you have a random number generator, you can use the `rand.Intn()` function to generate a random integer between `0` and the length of the slice of names. This integer can then be used as an index to select a random name from the slice.

package main  
  
import (  
    "fmt"  
    "math/rand"  
    "time"  
)  
  
func main() {  
    names := \[\]string{"Rodney", "Osodo", "David"}  
  
    // Seed the random number generator with the current time  
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())  
  
    // Generate a random integer between 0 and the length of the slice  
    randomIndex := rand.Intn(len(names))  
  
    // Select the name at the randomly generated index  
    randomName := names\[randomIndex\]  
  
    fmt.Println(randomName)  
}

**Code**

package namegenerator  
  
import (  
    "math/rand"  
    "sync"  
    "time"  
)  
  
// NameGenerator is an interface for generating names.  
type NameGenerator interface {  
    // Generate generates a name based on gender.  
    Generate() string  
  
    // GenerateNames generates a list of names.  
    GenerateNames(int) \[\]string  
}  
  
// nameGenerator is a struct that implements NameGenerator.  
type nameGenerator struct {  
    gender string  
}  
  
// NewNameGenerator returns a new NameGenerator.  
func NewNameGenerator(gender string) NameGenerator {  
    return &nameGenerator{  
        gender: gender,  
    }  
}  
  
func (namegen \*nameGenerator) Generate() string {  
    frandom := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))  
    grandom := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))  
  
    randonFamilyName := FamilyNames\[frandom.Intn(len(FamilyNames))\]  
  
    switch namegen.gender {  
    case "male":  
        randomMaleName := MaleNames\[grandom.Intn(len(MaleNames))\]  
  
        return randomMaleName + "-" + randonFamilyName  
    case "female":  
        randomFemaleName := FemaleNames\[grandom.Intn(len(FemaleNames))\]  
  
        return randomFemaleName + "-" + randonFamilyName  
    default:  
        randomName := GeneralNames\[grandom.Intn(len(GeneralNames))\]  
  
        return randomName + "-" + randonFamilyName  
    }  
}  
  
func (namegen \*nameGenerator) GenerateNames(count int) \[\]string {  
    var waitGroup sync.WaitGroup  
    names := make(\[\]string, count)  
  
    for i := 0; i < count; i++ {  
        waitGroup.Add(1)  
        go func(index int) {  
            defer waitGroup.Done()  
            names\[index\] = namegen.Generate()  
        }(i)  
    }  
  
    waitGroup.Wait()  
  
    return names  
}

We can generate a single name by calling the `Generate()` method on the `NameGenerator` interface. We can also generate a list of names by calling the `GenerateNames()` method on the `NameGenerator` interface.

### **Side Notes**

**1\. Adding a pre-commit hook**

A pre-commit hook is a script that executes before the commit is performed. It can be used to verify the commit message, examine the code for problems, and carry out any other necessary actions before the commit is made.

`pre-commit` is a Python package that is used to add a pre-commit hook. For controlling pre-commit hooks, this package offers a command-line interface. We use the following command to install the package:

pip install pre-commit

Once the package is installed, we can use the following command to add a pre-commit hook:

pre-commit install

This command will create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the current directory. This file contains the configuration for the pre-commit hook. We can edit this file to add our pre-commit hook.

This file contains the following configuration:

repos:  
  \- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks  
    rev: v4.4.0  
    hooks:  
      \- id: check-merge-conflict  
      \- id: check-yaml  
      \- id: end-of-file-fixer  
      \- id: trailing-whitespace  
      \- id: check-added-large-files  
  
  \- repo: https://github.com/dnephin/pre-commit-golang  
    rev: v0.5.1  
    hooks:  
      \- id: go-fmt  
      \- id: go-imports  
      \- id: no\-go-testing  
      \- id: golangci-lint  
      \- id: go-unit-tests  
      \- id: go-build

**2\. Adding Go-releaser**

Go-releaser is a tool that helps you release your Go projects. It automates the process of creating a release, uploading it to GitHub, and creating a release on GitHub. It also provides a command-line interface for managing releases.

To install Go-releaser, we use the following command:

go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest

The configuration for Go-releaser is stored in a file called `goreleaser.yml`. This file contains the following configuration:

before:  
  hooks:  
    \- go mod tidy  
  
builds:  
  \- skip: true  
  
archives:  
  \- format: tar.gz  
    name\_template: \>-  
      {{ .ProjectName }}\_  
      {{- title .Os }}\_  
      {{- if eq .Arch "amd64" }}x86\_64  
      {{- else if eq .Arch "386" }}i386  
      {{- else }}{{ .Arch }}{{ end }}  
      {{- if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}  
    format\_overrides:  
    \- goos: windows  
      format: zip  
checksum:  
  name\_template: 'checksums.txt'  
snapshot:  
  name\_template: "{{ incpatch .Version }}\-next"  
changelog:  
  sort: asc  
  filters:  
    exclude:  
      \- '^docs:'  
      \- '^test:'

Once the tool is installed, we use the following command to create a release:

goreleaser release

Instead of this, we will be using a [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/0x6flab/namegenerator/actions/runs/4908033011) to automate the release process.

**3\. Adding a CI/CD pipeline**

**3.1. Code Coverage with Codecov**

Codecov is a tool that helps you measure code coverage. It provides a command-line interface for measuring code coverage. It also provides a web interface for viewing the code coverage results.

To install Codecov, we use the following command:

go install github.com/codecov/codecov-action@latest

The configuration for Codecov is stored in a file called `codecov.yml`. This file contains the following configuration:

name: Test and coverage  
  
on: \[push, pull\_request\]  
  
jobs:  
  build:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      \- uses: actions/checkout@v2  
  
      \- uses: actions/setup-go@v2  
        with:  
          go-version: '1.19'  
  
      \- name: Run coverage  
        run: go test \-mod=vendor \-v \--race \-covermode=atomic \-coverprofile cover.txt  
  
      \- name: Upload coverage reports to Codecov  
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3  
        with:  
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV\_TOKEN }}  
          file: ./cover.txt  
          flags: unittests

**3.2. Run Examples with GitHub Actions**

name: Test and coverage  
  
on: \[push, pull\_request\]  
  
jobs:  
  build:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    strategy:  
      matrix:  
        go: \[ '1.19', '1.20' \]  
  
    name: Go ${{ matrix.go }} sample  
    steps:  
      \- uses: actions/checkout@v3  
  
      \- name: Setup go  
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4  
        with:  
          go-version: ${{ matrix.go }}  
  
      \- run: go run examples/female/main.go  
  
      \- run: go run examples/general/main.go  
  
      \- run: go run examples/male/main.go  
  
      \- run: go run examples/multiple/main.go

**3.3. Run Linting with GitHub Actions**

name: golangci-lint  
  
on: \[push, pull\_request\]  
  
permissions:  
  contents: read  
  
jobs:  
  golangci:  
    name: lint  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      \- uses: actions/setup-go@v4  
        with:  
          go-version: '1.19'  
          cache: false  
  
      \- uses: actions/checkout@v3  
  
      \- name: golangci-lint  
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v3  
        with:  
          version: v1.50.1  
  
          \# Optional: golangci-lint command line arguments.  
          args: \--enable-all \--disable misspell \--disable funlen \--disable gofumpt \--disable ireturn \--disable cyclop \--disable lll \--disable gosec \--disable gochecknoglobals \--disable paralleltest \--disable wsl \--disable gocognit

### **Conclusion**

In the end, my name generator surpassed all of my expectations. It was able to generate thousands of unique, human-readable names, each one more creative than the last. And as I looked back on my journey, I realized that sometimes the biggest challenges can lead to the greatest rewards.
