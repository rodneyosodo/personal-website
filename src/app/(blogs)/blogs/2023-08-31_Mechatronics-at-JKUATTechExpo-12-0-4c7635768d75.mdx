I know this update is long overdue - well past nine months, to be
exact - but sometimes life takes unexpected turns and priorities shift.
Nonetheless, I couldn't let this experience go unshared, especially when the
excitement and insights from the “**Mechatronics at JKUATTechExpo 12.0**”
are still fresh in my mind. So, here I am, finally sharing a glimpse into an
event that left a lasting impression.

It's quite a peculiar feeling, revisiting an event that happened months ago,
yet the memories and lessons learned are as vivid as ever. From the moment I
started writing about this event, I realized that the passage of time hadn't
dulled the impact it had on me. So, let's embark on a journey back in time as
I recount the thrills, challenges, and camaraderie that defined
“**Mechatronics at JKUATTechExpo 12.0.**”

The JKUAT Tech Expo has always been an event where engineers showcase their
talent and skills. Students usually look forward to the event, as it is usually
big and worth the buzz. The award for the top project, Ksh 100,000, usually
brings out the students' competitive spirit. People start preparing a whole
year in advance so as to win the cash prize. I am proud to have won the JKUAT
Tech Expo 10.0, and every year I look forward to winning again. Words can
barely express how exhilarating the entire process is.

Mechatronics is usually at the core of Tech Expo. We have our students
represent us in different elements of the event. For example, the 12.0 had
Mercy Mukiri as an organizing member, Spencer, Gilbert, and Washington as
exhibitors, Smith Jilks in the Judges section, and Sammy Oina in the panel
section. This is not a comprehensive list, but I have mentioned a few names to
show that Mechatronics students are key to the event. The JKUAT Tech Expo is
highly indebted to the mechatronics department in more ways than one.

To everyone who is aspiring to be an engineer, please participate in the Tech
Expo, it's a great chance to practically build something you will be proud of
and get a feel for the kind of ideas your friends have.

### Day 1

This is usually the most important day to gauge yourself, as you are able to
see most people's projects. Teams also present the different projects they
have to the present ‘local' judges and other judges who stream in from as
early as 9:00 a.m. to as late as 6:00 p.m.  
This is a lesson that I learned the hard way and would like to share with
future exhibitors. Please make sure you have a good breakfast and drink enough
water throughout the day; you will need it.

Some of the projects that were presented at the JKUAT Tech Expo 12.0 were:

1. **Team ForestFlare** by Samwel Waweru Kamau, Eddy Kimathi Gituma, Jonathan
   Wambua Ngei and Julia Wangechi Thaithi.

2. **DYNMI Energy** by Andrew Kamau Karanja and Migiro Johannes

3. **FiNd** by George Bange Ogeto and Tonny Maisha Ogeto  
   George says, “FiNd is a product meant to help students of JKUAT find lost IDs
   and report found IDs. It is a mobile-based solution using a camera, text
   recognition technology and alert notifications. It is a free-to-use platform
   for students at JKUAT. We hope to scale it to include more institutions in the
   future.”

4. **Home care innovator** by Zedekiah Karuri Gichuki and James Nyakera

5. **Visage** by Washington Kigani Kamadi (mechatronics), Valerian Kwamboka
   Nyerere and Mogire Earl Spencer (mechatronics).

Spencer says, “Visage is a face recognition device that will be used to
monitor class attendance by generating digital class attendance records instead
of students having to sign hardcopy sheets. Visage is therefore portable and
simple to mount in a class. The device comprises a microcomputer and a
Raspberry Pi camera. OpenCV is used to provide models for detecting and
recognizing faces. At this stage, a database of faces is yet to be created and
our face recognition efficiency is at 60% based on the images of people (3
people) we have trained with.”

6. **SignSpeak** by Mark Mboche Maara (mechatronics)

Mark says, “The first part is an AI (Artificial Intelligence) that can read
the hand gestures of someone who is signing and translate them into text. The
other part is an open graphics engine that takes text as input and can display
a digital character signing the input as sign language.”

7. **JuaMota** by Safa Osman, Gloria Muli, Washington Kamadi (mechatronics),
   and I.

Washington says, “Electrical machines are essential in industry, having a
high demand because they are dependable and can be safely operated. They are
the backbone of industrial applications all over the world. Although these
electromechanical devices are extremely reliable, they are prone to a variety
of faults. Motor condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are critical on
production lines. Early detection of potentially catastrophic faults can
significantly reduce maintenance costs and the risk of unexpected failures. To
detect faults, vibration, and motor current signature analyses are used.
Mechanical faults, such as bearing damage, and electrical faults, such as
unbalanced voltage, are some of the areas of interest. The key elements of the
Induction Motor fault detection scheme are condition monitoring, signal
processing, and data analysis.”

8. **Doser** by Michael Kimani (mechatronics), Felix Gateru (mechatronics),
   Washington Kamadi (mechatronics), and Timothy Kipkirui (mechatronics).

Timothy says, “Maize in the form of ugali is the staple food in Kenya. With
the increasing price of packaged flour, more people are turning to posho mills
as their source of maize flour. One advantage that packaged flour has over
maize flour from the posho mill is the fortification that it undergoes  
during production, which is a directive of the HO. The flour obtained from the
posho mills does not contain such fortification minerals as zinc, which are
essential for good health and development.  
If not addressed, this may lead to hidden hunger among a large proportion of
the population, exposing them to disease and infections. There is a need to
develop a system of fortification for posho mills to ensure that all flour
contains the required minerals. A doser is a low-cost device meant to integrate
with existing posho mills in order to fortify the flour produced.  
This device offers a variable quantity of nutrients depending on the amount of
flour to be fortified. The design, which makes it easily attached to existing
posho mills, will present a wide market for the product as we seek to address
hidden hunger and SDG 3 of good health and well-being.”

9. **Omicron Robot** by Garvins Maraiga (mechatronics), Ruth Naibei, and I.

I say, “The vast majority of mobile platforms available today are
non-holonomic. They only have one or two independent degrees of freedom. As a
result, its maneuverability is limited, and it frequently requires a lot of
space to perform functions like turning and parking. By increasing a
vehicle's degrees of freedom and maneuverability, it can take various complex
trajectories that non-holonomic vehicles find difficult or impossible to take.  
As a result, this project designs and develops a prototype mobile platform with
holonomic and omnidirectional motion using castor wheels. Castors are used to
move heavy loads in a variety of industries. Because castor wheels are
difficult to control, we intend to introduce Direct Current Motors that will
enable castor wheel control. The design will include the selection of
direct-current motors and power transmission systems based on the amount of
power required to move heavy loads.  
The goal of this design is to give casters some form of control. This control
will be accomplished by varying motor speed and direction, resulting in varying
degrees of motion. This control will be accomplished remotely using hand motion
control or a mobile application interface, depending on the application area.
This will necessitate sophisticated software development, which will be
accomplished through the use of high-level programming languages such as Python
and Dart while leveraging low-level capabilities to increase run time.  
The goal is to have a prototype mobile platform capable of carrying a load of
40kg at the end of the design and fabrication process. This platform will not
require manual control, but will instead be operated remotely via mobile
application software or hand motion control.”

10. **Cardio Intelligent Monitoring System** by Kariithi Anne Wanjiku, Maranga
    Sarah Nungari, Abraham Korir, and I

Anne says, “Systems for remote ECG monitoring of the heart are becoming
widely used medical devices. The quality of the transmission and reception of
the ECG signals during the remote procedure has improved over the past few
years as more and more cardiac illnesses have been monitored using remote ECG
monitoring devices.  
However, further difficulties persist. Currently, in Kenya, where this
technology isn't widespread, it is difficult to monitor patients with heart
conditions. There are scarce resources available for remote heart monitoring
since this technology is still in hospitals and people have to go back to
hospitals to get checked.  
As a result, it would be prudent to develop a new, non-invasive wireless
technology that would address the aforementioned issues while also monitoring
the patient's vital parameters. The proposed biosensor would have a chest
unit mounted on the patient's anterior chest wall and will include an ECG
sensor for monitoring the patient's heart fields. The signals will then be
analyzed using machine learning. Have a 3-lead ECG done to check the
patient's heart function. Vitals such as heart rate, temperature, and oxygen
saturation will be measured by the limb unit.  
If possible, the limb unit should perform a blood gas analysis to determine the
pH of the patient's blood, as well as the carbon dioxide and bicarbonate
levels. The limb unit's parameters will reduce the number of invasive
procedures performed on a newborn.”

### Day 2

The day kicks off with exhibitors, the same as the first day. The next session
is usually a panel session. This panel discussed “Transforming Innovations
into Start-ups”.  
Some of the areas of concern were:

1. The process the panelist has taken to get to where they are and what are
   the key takeaways from their journey.
2. The financial concepts needed to get an innovation to success
3. The thoughts of the panelists on the major reasons startups fail
4. How insurance companies and banks are utilized for the success of a
   startup.
5. Tips and tricks in terms of resources, either software, human, or capital,
   that can be leveraged for the success of innovation.

The prize ceremony took place in the afternoon, and Nishati Safi, a
solar-powered food cart, took the stage as JKUAT conducted its twelfth tech
expo edition. During the two-day expo, “Sign Speak” came in second. The
idea, which took third place, uses science and technology to organically
eradicate the mites and keep track of the health of the bees.

### Takeaway

Prof. Walter Oyawa, director general of the National Commission for Science,
Technology, and Innovation (NACOSTI), praised the innovations shown by the
students during the Tech Expo's opening ceremony and asserted that innovation
was the key to the transformation of the nation.

However, he conceded that in order for the innovation to advance to the stage
of commercialization, concentrated efforts were required to ensure the
innovations' progress and enable Kenya to fulfill its technology and
innovation objectives.

Prof. Victoria Ngumi, vice chancellor, requested assistance from the public and
private sectors to facilitate the incubation and commercialization of student
inventions. She also urged the innovators to actively promote the achievement
of the new government's development goal for the benefit of Kenyans through
their innovations.
