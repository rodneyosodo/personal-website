In the dimly lit confines of my house, I embarked on a journey from De-Googling
my life to creating a homelab that would evolve into a brilliant tapestry of
technology and learning. Hi, I'm [Rodney Osodo](https://rodneyosodo.com/),
known as [@blackd0t](https://twitter.com/b1ackd0t) on Twitter, and I'm not
just a software engineer; I'm the curator of my [homelab
adventure](https://github.com/rodneyosodo/homelab/tree/v1.0.0). The walls of my
homelab are adorned with servers and the hum of endless possibilities as I dive
into the world of new technologies and host my projects. This digital
playground, my homelab, has become the canvas for my exploration.

With goals ranging from liberating myself from the clutches of Google to
creating a robust, highly available infrastructure for my projects, each
checkbox became a stepping stone toward homelab brilliance. The allure of a
scalable environment with no single point of failure beckoned me, pushing the
boundaries of my understanding. Learning new technologies isn't just a task;
it is a thrilling adventure, and having fun is the north star guiding my every
endeavour.

Reaching the point where I can proudly declare, “I have a homelab,” feels like a
significant milestone. It might not be the most expensive setup, but it's mine -
a carefully curated space where technology and creativity intertwine.

The heartbeat of my homelab is a Raspberry Pi (Heimdall), dutifully serving as
a backup server running. Alongside it stands a mini PC (Odin), my trusted
central server, orchestrating various services. Another mini PC, Hœnir,
proudly takes on the role of my main workstation, where countless lines of code
come to life. My laptop, Dellingr, transforms into a mobile workstation for
those on-the-go moments, ensuring productivity knows no bounds. As my homelab
continues to evolve, there's a promise of more servers on the horizon, each
waiting to join the ensemble. The journey has just begun, and the prospect of
enhancing my homelab with additional servers and services makes the future brim
with possibilities.

### **Heimdall**

- 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian 12 running kernel: 6.1)

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

- 4GB RAM

- 64 GB SD Card

- 1x 4TB HDD as data disk

This server is used exclusively as a backup server. I use it to back up my
homelab machines and possibly my family's machines. When selecting
Heimdall's hardware, reliability took precedence over sheer power. The
Raspberry Pi 4, known for its affordability and stability, became the natural
choice. Opting for the 4GB RAM version ensured the smooth operation of the
64-bit OS and the backup software, creating a balance between performance and
cost-effectiveness. I chose a 64GB SD card for the OS, while a 4TB HDD is the
data disk. The intention was not only to store backups but also to maintain
multiple copies for added reliability.

However, the journey had its challenges. An unforeseen block size discrepancy
between the Raspberry Pi (using 512 blocks) and the HDD (with a 4096 block
size) led to an unfortunate compatibility issue. Here is the
[issue](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=334314). Despite
attempts to integrate the Proxmox Backup Server, both as the base OS or
containerised, the hurdles persisted, prompting a reevaluation of the setup.
Here is the
[issue](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/pbs-on-a-raspberry-pi.85051/).

In response to these challenges, I will transition Heimdall's duties to an
Intel N100 mini PC. This upgrade aims to overcome the compatibility issues and
provide a seamless environment for backup operations.

### **Odin**

- Proxmox 8.1.4 (Debian 12 running kernel: 6.5.11-7-pve)

- AMD Ryzen 7 4800H with Radeon Graphics (16) @ 1.4GHz - 2.9GHz

- 32 GB DDR4-3200 Memory

- 1x 1 TB NVMe SSD as boot disk

- 1x 2 TB HDD as data disk

My primary server is hosted on this machine. I use it to run all of my
virtualised and containerised services. At the moment, I have a VM called Bohr
that runs all my services. I will add more VMs soon for testing and running
Kubernetes.

I chose the AMD Ryzen 7 4800H with Radeon Graphics (16) @ 1.4GHz - 2.9GHz
because it's cheap and reliable. I picked the 32 GB DDR4-3200 Memory to
have enough RAM to run the OS and the services. I will upgrade to 64 GB
DDR4-3200 Memory as soon as my needs grow. I chose a 1 TB NVMe SSD as the
boot disk. I picked a 2 TB HDD as a data disk because I wanted enough storage
for the VMS. I will probably increase the number of VMs as my needs grow. I
will add more storage as my needs grow.

This server is the most powerful in my homelab. It runs proxmox as the base OS.
I have configured proxmox to use ZFS as the storage backend. It utilises the 2
TB HDD as the data disk. ZFS is pretty cool. It allows me to create snapshots
of the data disk. I can use these snapshots to restore the data disk to a
previous state. I have also configured scheduled backups of the VM. This
happens every night at 2 AM.

- **cloudflared** is a tunnelling daemon that proxies any local webserver
  through the Cloudflare network. It secures traffic, hides your origin server IP
  address, and blocks malicious traffic.
- **pihole** is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content
  without installing client-side software. I use it to block ads and track
  network activity. It also serves as a DNS server with unbound as the upstream
  DNS server.

- **endlessh** is an SSH tarpit that sends an endless, random SSH banner very
  slowly. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days. Instead of
  bothering a real server, the purpose is to put your SSH server on another port
  and let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit.

### Conclusion

In the grand scheme of my homelab evolution, I'm gearing up for a
transformative leap to version 2.0. The impending upgrade involves adding new
machines and expanding services, marking a significant architectural shift with
the introduction of Kubernetes. The decision between k3s and k8s is yet to be
finalised as I immerse myself in the intricacies of these powerful
orchestration tools, navigating the vast landscape of containerised deployments.

Beyond the orchestration prowess of Kubernetes, version 2.0 heralds the dawn of
Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Terraform will take the reins, orchestrating the
provisioning of machines, while Ansible handles the configuration of services
deftly. This dual approach ensures a streamlined, automated, and scalable
infrastructure, paving the way for efficient management and future expansion.

The endgame for this ambitious homelab upgrade is nothing short of a highly
available marvel. By eliminating single points of failure, both in hardware and
software, I aim to fortify the foundation of my homelab. Every system and byte
of data will be diligently backed up and protected, forming an impenetrable
fortress of resilience. I will implement load balancing and failover mechanisms
to guarantee the highest service availability, creating a homelab that meets
and exceeds my expectations.

The roadmap includes continuous monitoring to ensure peak performance and the
implementation of a reliable failover strategy for all services. As the
curtains rise on version 2.0, I anticipate a landscape reshaped by the evolving
workloads, promising a dynamic and ever-improving homelab environment in the
coming weeks and years. The journey ahead is discovery, growth, and the
relentless pursuit of homelab excellence.
